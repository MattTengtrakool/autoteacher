In the text editor, write code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user to agree  char  c  =  get_char ( "Do you agree? " );// Check whether agreed  if  ( c  ==  'Y'  ||  c  ==  'y' )  {  printf ( "Agreed.\n " );}  else  if  ( c  ==  'N'  ||  c  ==  'n' )  {  printf ( "Not agreed.\n " );}  }  Notice that single quotes are utilized for single characters. Further, notice that code: == ensure that something is equal to something else, where a single equal sign would have a very different function in C. Finally, notice that code: || effectively means or .- You can test your code by typing code: make agree into the terminal window, followed by code: ./agree .## Loops  - We can also utilize the loops building block from Scratch in our C programs.-  In your terminal window, type code: code meow.c and write code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "meow \n " );printf ( "meow \n " );printf ( "meow \n " );}  Notice this does as intended but has an opportunity for better design.-  We can improve our program by modifying your code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  i  =  0 ;while  ( i  <  3 )  {  printf ( "meow \n " );i ++ ;}  }  Notice that we create an code: int called code: i and assign it the value code: 0 . Then, we create a code: while loop that will run as long as code: i < 3 . Then, the loop runs. Every time code: 1 is added to code: i using the code: i++ statement.-  Similarly, we can implement a count-down of sorts by modifying our code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  i  =  3 ;while  ( i  >  0 )  {  printf ( "meow \n " );i -- ;}  }  Notice how our counter code: i is started at code: 3 . Each time the loop runs, it will reduce the counter by code: 1 . Once the counter is less than zero, it will stop the loop.-  We can further improve the design using a code: for loop.
