Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  3 ;i ++ )  {  printf ( "meow \n " );}  }  Notice that the code: for loop includes three arguments. The first argument code: int i = 0 starts our counter at zero. The second argument code: i < 3 is the condition that is being checked. Finally, the argument code: i++ tells the loop to increment by one each time the loop runs.-  We can even loop forever using the following code:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  while  ( true )  {  printf ( "meow \n " );}  }  Notice that code: true will always be the case. Therefore, the code will always run. You will lose control of your terminal window by running this code. You can break from an infinite by hitting code: control-C on your keyboard.## Linux and the Command Line  - Linux is an operating system that is accessible via the command line in the terminal window in VS Code.- Some common command-line arguments we may use include:- code: cd , for changing our current directory (folder)  - code: cp , for copying files and directories  - code: ls , for listing files in a directory  - code: mkdir , for making a directory  - code: mv , for moving (renaming) files and directories  - code: rm , for removing (deleting) files  - code: rmdir , for removing (deleting) directories  - The most commonly used is code: ls which will list all the files in the current directory or directory. Go ahead and type code: ls into the terminal window and hit code: enter . Youâ€™ll see all the files in the current folder.- Another useful command is code: mv , where you can move a file from one file to another. For example, you could use this command to rename code: Hello.c (notice the uppercase code: H ) to code: hello.c by typing code: mv Hello.c hello.c .- You can also create folders.
