Further, notice that there is a region in the middle called a text editor where you can edit your program. Finally, there is a code: command line interface , known as a CLI ,command line , or terminal window where we can send commands to the computer in the cloud.-  We can build your first program in C by typing code: code hello.c into the terminal window. Notice that we deliberately lowercased the entire filename and included the code: .c extension. Then, in the text editor that appears, write code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, world \n " );}  Note that every single character above serves a purpose. If you type it incorrectly, the program will not run.- Clicking back in the terminal window, you can compile your code by executing code: make hello . Notice that we are omitting code: .c .code: make is a compiler that will look for our code: hello.c file and turn it into a program called code: hello . If executing this command results in no errors, you can proceed. If not, double-check your code to ensure it matches the above.- Now, type code: ./hello and your program will execute saying code: hello, world .- Now, open the file explorer on the left. You will notice that there is now both a file called code: hello.c and another file called code: hello .code: hello.c is able to be read by the compiler: It’s where your code is stored.code: hello is an executable file that you can run, but cannot be read by the compiler.-  Let’s look at our code more carefully:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, world \n " );}  Notice that our code is highlighted using syntax highlighting.## Functions  - In Scratch, we utilized the code: say block to display any text on the screen. Indeed, in C, we have a function called code: printf that does exactly this.-  Notice our code already invokes this function:code: printf ( "hello, world \n " );Notice that the printf function is called. The argument passed to printf is ‘hello, world\n’.
