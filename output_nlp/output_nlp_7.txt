You can type code: mkdir pset1 to create a directory called code: pset1 .- You can then use code: cd pset1 to change your current directory to code: pset1 .## Mario  - Everything weâ€™ve discussed today has focused on various building-blocks of your work as a programmer.- The following will help you orient toward working on a problem set for this class in general: How does one approach a computer science related problem?  -  Imagine we wanted to emulate the visual of the game Super Mario Bros. Considering the four question-blocks pictured, how could we create code that roughly represents these four horizontal blocks?  -  In the terminal window, type code: code mario.c and code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  4 ;i ++ )  {  printf ( "?" );}  printf ( " \n " );}  Notice how four question marks are printed here using a loop.-  Similarly, we can apply this same logic to be able to create three vertical blocks.-  To accomplish this, modify your code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  3 ;i ++ )  {  printf ( "# \n " );}  }  Notice how three vertical bricks are printed using a loop.-  What if we wanted to combine these ideas to create a three-by-three group of blocks?  -  We can follow the logic above, combining the same ideas. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  3 ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  3 ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "#" );}  printf ( " \n " );}  }  Notice that one loop is inside another. The first loop defines what vertical row is being printed. For each row, three columns are printed. After each row, a new line is printed.-  What if we wanted to ensure that the number of blocks to be constant , that is, unchangeable?
