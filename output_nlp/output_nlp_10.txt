For example, a code: char is designed to accommodate a single character like code: a or code: 2 .- Types are very important because each type has specific limits. For example, because of the limits in memory, the highest value of an code: int can be code: 4294967296 .-  Types with which you might interact during this course include:- code: bool , a Boolean expression of either true or false  - code: char , a single character like a or 2  - code: double , a floating-point value with more digits than a float  - code: float , a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value  - code: int , integers up to a certain size, or number of bits  - code: long , integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an int  - code: string , a string of characters  -  You can implement a calculator in C. In your terminal, type code: code calculator.c and write code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user for x  int  x  =  get_int ( "x: " );// Prompt user for y  int  y  =  get_int ( "y: " );// Perform addition  printf ( "%i \n " ,x  +  y );}  Notice how the code: get_int function is utilized to obtain an integer from the user twice. One integer is stored in the code: int variable called code: x . Another is stored in the code: int variable called code: y . Then, the code: printf function prints the value of code: x + y , designated by the code: %i symbol.- As you are coding, pay special attention to the types of variables you are using to avoid problems within your code.## Summing Up  In this lesson, you learned how to apply the building blocks you learned in Scratch to the C programming language.
