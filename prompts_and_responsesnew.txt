Prompt: -  The code: get_string function is used to get a string from the user. The function returns a string, which we save in the variable called code: answer. Later, we use the code: printf function to print out the string stored in code: answer. The special code: %s is replaced by the string stored in code: answer at runtime.  -  Using the code: get_string function, ask the user for their age and save it in a variable called code: age. Then, using the code: printf function, print “I am ___ years old.”, with the blank replaced by the user’s age.  -  What happens if you enter a non-numeric
Response: -  The code: get_string function returns a string, which we save in the variable called code: answer. Later, we use the code: printf function to print out the string stored in code: answer. The special code: %s is replaced by the string stored in code: answer at runtime.  -  Using the code: get_string function, ask the user for their age and save it in a variable called code: age. Then, using the code: printf function, print “I am ___ years old.”, with the blank replaced by the user’s age.  -  What happens if you enter a non-numeric answer for your age?  -  A more sophisticated way

Prompt: -  The code: string answer = get_string("What's your name?"); line declares a variable called code: answer of type code: string and assigns the value returned by the code: get_string function to it.  - The code: get_string function is a part of the CS50 library that you included at the top of your code.- The statement code: printf("hello, %s \n",answer); is a C function that prints a string to the terminal window.  -  The code: %s is a placeholder for the code: answer variable that is assigned to the string being printed.- The code: \n is the C escape sequence for a new line.  -  In your terminal window
Response: -  By the way, you can read about all the capabilities of the CS50 library on the Manual Pages.-  You will also notice that in the code: get_string function, there is a space character after the question mark. This space is required, otherwise the input (i.e., the name) will appear right next to the question mark.  -  Recall that in Scratch, if you wanted to display your name, you would write code: say [name] for [2] secs.  -  In C, you would use the following statement: printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );  -  In C, the %s is a placeholder for a string. In the statement

Prompt: -  The code: string answer = get_string("What's your name?"); defines a string variable called answer and assigns it to the string inputted by the user.  -  The code: printf("hello, %s \n", answer); uses the code: printf function to print out a string, hello and the value of answer, which is the inputted string. -  In your terminal window, run code: clang hello.c -o hello -lcs50. This will compile your program and create a binary file called hello. Running code: ./hello should now provide you with the same functionality as your Scratch program did.  -  A variable can store not only strings, but also integers.
Response: -  Notice how the code: string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " ); is different from the code: string  answer  =  get_string ( );? We can specify what question to ask the user by putting it in between the code: ( ).  -  If we want to make our program more friendly, we can use the code: printf function to print out a prompt to the user before they are asked the question. Try modifying your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "What's your name? " );string  answer  =

Prompt: -  Execute your program by typing code: ./hello in your terminal window. How does this program differ from your last one?-  The code: get_string function returns a string. A string is a quote-delimited sequence of characters. Strings in C are represented by the code: string type. Like all types, a string has a size. In this case, the size of a string is the maximum number of characters that it can store, not counting the terminating null character code: \0. The terminating null character code: \0 is automatically appended to the end of a string.  -  What is the difference between the following two lines of code?code: char  c  =  '
Response: -  What is the difference between the following two lines of C code?code: int  x  =  5   char  y  =  'a'  -  The first line of C code assigns the value 5 of type int to the variable x. The second line of C code assigns the value 'a' of type char to the variable y.  -  What is the difference between the following two lines of C code?code: int  x  =  get_string ( "Enter a number: " );char  y  =  get_string ( "Enter a letter: " );-  The first line of C code assigns the value returned by the get_string function to the variable x.

Prompt: -  Also notice that you have now declared a variable code: answer of type string. This is where we will store the user’s input. -  Notice code: %s in the code: printf function. This is called string interpolation. It prints the value of the variable code: answer in the string.  -  In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will now be met with numerous errors! These errors are caused due to the new library code: <cs50.h> being included in your code.  -  In order to use this library, you must first download it. In your terminal window, execute code: cd to change directories into your home directory. Then execute the following command
Response: -  Now, if you run code: make hello again, you will see that there are no errors.-  In your terminal window, execute code: ./hello. What does your program do?-  How would you change your program to say “how are you?” instead of “hello”?-  When you are finished, don’t forget to commit your work to Git!-  In your terminal window, execute code: git add hello.c to add your changes to Git. Then execute code: git commit -m "added hello program" to commit your changes. Finally, execute code: git push to push your changes to GitHub.-  Finally, go to the Lab 1 page on GitHub

Prompt: -  Because we want to store what the user types for their name in a variable called answer, we use the code: string data type.-  The code: printf function is used to print out what is stored in a variable. Notice the %s in the text. This is placeholder for the value of the variable that will be printed there.  -  Compile and run your program.-  What is the output of your program?-  What happens if you change the %s to %c?-  What happens if you change the %s to %i?-  What happens if you change the %s to %f?-  What happens if you change the %s to %s?-  What happens if
Response: -  What is the output of your program?-  What happens if you change the %s to %c?-  What happens if you change the %s to %i?-  What happens if you change the %s to %f?-  What happens if you change the %s to %s?-  What happens if The statement of code is closed with a code: ;.-  A common error in C programming is the omission of a semicolon. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, world \n " )  }  Notice the semicolon is now gone.- In

Prompt: -  Try running your program by executing code: make hello. Typing code:./hello in the terminal, you will be met with a prompt asking you for your name, which you can enter and hit code: return. The words “hello,” followed by your name, should now appear in the terminal.  -  The code: get_string function is defined in the CS50 library, but the code: printf function is still defined in the stdio library.  -  Try running your program again, this time with the code: get_string function commented out. You should see the same output as before. This is because the code: printf function will automatically print out a newline code: \n character
Response: -  We have also defined a variable called code: answer. Variables are named strings of characters that store data. Think of them as “containers” that can hold various data types, including strings, integers, floats, and more.  -  To define a variable in C, you first provide the data type, followed by the name of the variable. In the example above, we have defined a variable called code: answer of type string.  -  In the assignment code: answer = get_string("What's your name?");, we are assigning the value returned from the code: get_string function to the code: answer variable.  -  To print out a variable, you use the code:

Prompt: - Try running code: ./hello again. Notice what happens.- Notice the difference between code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); and the following code:int age = get_int("What is your age? ");  - What is the difference between code: string and code: int?  -  What would happen if you modified your program as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );}  Try running the program.  -
Response: -  Also, notice that the code: string keyword and the code: answer variable have been declared.  -  The code: string keyword is used to declare a string variable.  -  The code: answer variable is a place holder for the string that the user enters.-  The code: %s is a format specifier and is used to print the value of the code: answer variable.- Finally, the code: \n is a new line character, which is just a way of adding a blank line to your program.  -  Try running your code in the terminal window.  -  Type in a name and notice how your program responds.  -  Try running your code in the terminal window again.  -

Prompt: What is the purpose of the statement "#include <cs50.h>"?
Response: -  The code: get_string function will also ask the user a question. You can specify that question by putting it in double quotes within the parentheses. -  After creating a new string variable called code: answer, the code: printf function is used to print a string to the terminal. You can specify the string you want to print by putting it within double quotes. You can also specify additional strings that you want to print on the same line. You can do so by putting a comma after the first string and then adding another string that you want to print.  -  In this case, you want to print code: answer as well. You can specify a variable that you want to print instead of a string by putting it in

Prompt: -  Once the string is obtained, it is stored in a variable called code: answer. The code: printf function allows you to print a string with a variable appended to the end of it.  -  In this case, the %s is replaced by code: answer. If your code looks like the above, you should see the following output in your terminal window:What's your name? Davidhello, David-  The C programming language is statically typed, which means that every variable must have a type. The type of a variable determines the size of the variable’s memory location and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.- The type of the variable code: answer is string. A string in C is really an array
Response: -  The function code: get_string returns a string that is stored in a variable called answer. The code: printf function allows you to print a string with a variable appended to the end of it.  -  In this case, the %s is replaced by answer. If your code looks like the above, you should see the following output in your terminal window:What's your name? Davidhello, David-  The C programming language is statically typed, which means that every variable must have a type. The type of a variable determines the size of the variable’s memory location and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.- The type of the variable answer is string. A string in C is really an array The statement

Prompt: - The code: string data type is being used to store the user’s response in a variable called code: answer.-  The code: printf function has been modified to include the code: %s placeholder. This placeholder is replaced with the contents of the code: answer variable. The code: \n is still used to indicate a new line.- In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will now be met with numerous errors! Placing the semicolon back in the correct position and running code: make hello again, the errors go away.- Notice also the special symbol code: \n in your code. Try removing those characters and making your program again by executing code: make hello. Typing code:./
Response: -  The string is stored in a variable called code: answer. The code: printf function has been modified to include the code: %s placeholder. This placeholder is replaced with the contents of the code: answer variable. The code: \n is still used to indicate a new line.-  In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will now be met with numerous errors! Placing the semicolon back in the correct position and running code: make hello again, the errors go away.-  Notice also the special symbol code: \n in your code. Try removing those characters and making your program again by executing code: make hello. Typing code:./hello in the terminal window, how did your program change

Prompt: -  Try running your program by executing code: make hello. You will now be able to type in your name and the program will say hello to you.- Next, let’s try something different. What if we wanted to ask the user their age and then say hello again, but this time with the age appended to it? Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  age  =  get_int ( "What's your age? " );printf ( "hello, you are %i years old \n ",age );}  -  Can you try and figure out
Response: By convention, variable names in C start with a lowercase letter.  The code: string is a data type.  A data type is a category of data that the program can manipulate.  The type of data that a variable can hold and the size (in bytes) of that data is determined by the data type.  Here, the data type is a string, which can hold a sequence of characters.  Note that code: string is a custom data type that is defined in code: cs50.h.  The code: get_string function returns a string (which is assigned to the variable code: answer).  The code: printf function accepts a string as its first argument, followed by a comma-separated list

Prompt: What's the difference between the stdio.h and cs50.h libraries?
Response: -  The keyword string is a data type in C. It is used to store text.-  The keyword int is a data type in C. It is used to store whole numbers.-  The keyword float is a data type in C. It is used to store decimal numbers.-  The keyword char is a data type in C. It is used to store letters.-  The keyword bool is a data type in C. It is used to store true and false values.-  The keyword void is a data type in C. It is used to store nothing.-  The keyword get_string is a function that returns a string from the user. It is a function that is part of cs50.h. It will ask the user the

Prompt: What's the difference between the stdio library and the cs50 library?
Response: -  Compile your program and test it out.  -  Notice how the statement: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); has two parts separated by a code: = sign. The first part is called a variable and the second part is called an assignment.  -  In this case, the variable code: answer is of type string. This means that it can store a list of characters. The assignment code: get_string("What's your name? "); gets a string from the user.  -  In C, all variables must be declared with a specific type. The type defines the kind of data that the variable can store.  -  Try the following program:code: #

Prompt: -  In C, variables can be one of many data types, such as an integer, a character, or a string. In the code above, answer is a variable of type string. Notice also the way in which you print out the user’s name. You use the code: %s to denote that the next parameter is a string.  -  Execute the following commands in order:- code: clang -o hello hello.c-  ./hello-  What’s your name? Binky-  hello, Binky!-  How would you modify this program to also ask the user how old they are?

#include <cs50.h> 
#include <stdio.h> 
int main(void) 
{ 
string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); 
printf("hello, %s \n", answer); 
}

Prompt: -  Try running code: make hello again at the terminal window and then code: ./hello. What happens when you hit the Enter key?- Now that we know how to get user input, we can assign the user input to a variable. Add the following code to your program:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );    printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );}  Notice the code: string answer = get_string("What's your name?");
Response: -  Let’s break down the code: printf("hello, %s \n", answer);. The code: printf function is used to print out various types of information. The code: %s is a placeholder for the “string” variable called answer. The code: \n is used to start a new line. The code: ; informs the compiler that the statement is finished.- The code: get_string function is used to get a string from the user.-  The code: printf function is used to print out various types of information. The code: %s is a placeholder for the “string” variable called answer. The code: \n is used to start a new line. The code

Prompt: -  The code: string keyword is used to declare a new variable called answer of type string.  -  Instead of printing out code: "hello, world"  as we did before, we are now printing out code: "hello, answer" where answer is the string that we got back from the user.  -  The code: %s is a format specifier that tells the code: printf function to print out a string.  -  The code: get_string function returns a string, and so answer is now a string.  -  The statement code: printf ("hello, %s \n", answer); will print out the string code: "hello, answer" where answer is the string that the

Prompt: -  Notice that there is now a new symbol, code: %s, in the code: printf statement. This is called a format specifier. The format specifier tells the program that there will be a string that will be inserted in place of code: %s in the output.  -  Execute code: ./hello in your terminal window. Try answering with your name, and then try answering with just one character. What happens the second time you run the program with just one character?-  Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string
Response: -  Notice that the string has the type string. The type of a variable is very important in C. C does not care about the meaning of a string, only that it is a string of a certain type.-  In Scratch, we only had strings, numbers, and booleans.-  In C, we have many different types of strings, numbers, and booleans. The type of string that you use will affect the size of memory that your program will use. In this program, we are only interested in storing the name of a person, so we don’t need to use a lot of memory.  -  In C, it is important to Strike A Balance between the meaning of a variable and the

Prompt: -  Execute the following in your terminal window to compile your program: code: make hello.c-  Now run your program by typing code: ./hello  -  How would you modify the program to ask the user “What is your age?” and then respond accordingly? (e.g. “Wow! You’re old/young!”)-

What is the statement of code closed with?
Response: -  Now compile and run your program. What happens when you type in a number? What if you type in a word with a space like “hello world”? Modify your program so it only runs correctly when a name is entered.-  What is a variable? A variable is a place in memory where we can store data of various types. In this program, you created a variable called code: answer of type code: string-.  What is a string? A string is a sequence of characters. The code: string  data type is used to store a sequence of characters. In this program, you stored the name of the user in the code: answer  variable.  -  What is the difference between code:

Prompt: -  In your terminal window, run code: clang hello.c -lcs50 to compile your program with the CS50 library included. Execute the program by typing code: ./a.out. Type your name when prompted and see the output!-  Modify your program to ask the user not only their name but also their age. After the user enters both their name and age, output a sentence that says “hello, [name] who is [age] years old!”-  Recall in Scratch, we had the ability to use the “ask” and “answer” blocks. Using those blocks, we could store the user’s response in a variable that we could
Response: -  The code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); means that the code: get_string function will prompt the user to type a name on the screen. What the user types will be stored in the memory location identified by the name code: answer. The memory location code: answer is of type string. -  The memory location code: answer is of type string. Recall that in Scratch, when you ask the user “What’s your name?”, the response is a string (i.e., text).  -  The memory location code: answer is of type string. Recall that in Scratch, when you ask the user “What’s your

Prompt: What is the difference between the semicolon and the comma in C programming?
Response: -  The code: %s is a placeholder for the string that the user types. The code: get_string function gives us a string type and the code: printf function knows to put the user’s string in that spot.  -  The code: \n is a special character, called a newline, which tells the terminal to start printing on a new line. This is necessary to prevent printf from printing everything on the same line as what the user typed.-  Now, run code: make hello again. Executing code: ./hello in the terminal window, the program will ask for the user’s name and then say hello with the user’s name appended to it.  -  Try

Prompt: -  The variable code: string answer is declared and initialized to the value returned from code: get_string. -  The code: printf function is used to print output to the screen.  -  The %s is replaced with the value of code: answer. -  The \n is a special character known as a newline. It tells the terminal to start printing on the next line.  -  Try running your program. In the terminal window, execute code: make hello. You will now be able to run your program by typing code: ./hello. Try it out!  -  Finally, notice how the code is now much more readable.  -  Modify your program so that it asks the user
Response: -  The code: string answer is declared, which is a variable that can hold a string.  -  The code: get_string is run and the user input is stored in the variable code: answer.  -  The code: printf function is used to print the string code: hello, %s \n to the terminal window. The %s is replaced with the value of answer, which is the user input. Notice that there is a space in the string before the %s. This is so the output appears nice and clean.  -  Try running your program and see what it does!  -  A string is a sequence of characters. The characters can be letters, numbers or symbols. You can think of

Prompt: - Notice also the code: string keyword. This keyword is used to create a data type called a string. A string is just a sequence of characters.- The code: get_string function assigns the user’s input to the code: answer variable. The code: string keyword is used to indicate that the code: answer variable should be able to store a string of characters. The code: printf function is used to print out a string of characters. The %s characters in the string tell the code: printf function that it should print the contents of the code: answer variable in that spot.- Try running your program by executing code: ./hello in your terminal window. Type your name when prompted and hit enter. The program should say
Response: -  Notice that the string you input when prompted is now printed out as part of the hello statement!-  As you learned in the last lesson, a variable is “a value that can change.” This makes variables very powerful, as the value of a variable can change based on different inputs from the user. While you can type literal values (like code: "hello" or code: 42) into your C programs, you can also define variables and assign them values.## Variables (cont.)  - For example, if you wanted to ask a user how old they are, you could create a variable and assign it the number they input. Modify your program as follows:code: #include  <cs50

Prompt: What is the difference between the statement "#include <stdio.h>" and the statement "#include <cs50.h>"?
Response: -  The code: string keyword is used to create a new variable called code: answer of type "string".- To use the string that is returned by the code: get_string function, you use the code: %s format specifier in your code: printf function. This is a placeholder for a string that can be used later in the code.- Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );}  Notice that the semicolon is now

Prompt: -  In C, we also have something called variables. Variables are places in memory where we can store data. In this case, we have a variable called code: answer which is of type code: string. Variables are assigned values using the code: = operator.- After asking for the user’s name and storing it in the code: answer variable, the code: printf function is used to print a string, which in this case is code: "hello, %s \n". The %s is a placeholder for the code: answer variable. The \n is used to insert a newline character.- The statement code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); declares a variable of type
Response: The code: printf function is used to print a string. In this case, the string has a placeholder for our variable called code: answer.  -  This is the output of our code:$ ./hello  What's your name? David  hello, David-  Try changing the value of the code: string answer variable though. For example, change it to "my name is David" and see what happens.-  You can also try adding multiple statements to print other things to the terminal window. For example:code: printf ( "hello, world \n " );printf ( "hello, my name is David \n " );  -  What happens when you try reordering the statements? For example, what happens if

Prompt: -  The code: %s symbols inside the quotes of the code: printf function tell the program to print the string that is stored in the answer variable.  -  Notice that in the code: get_string function, there are two double quotes side by side. This is how you indicate that you want a literal quotation mark in your string, otherwise the program will think you want to end the string.  -  Try running your program in the terminal window by typing code: make hello (assuming you have saved your program with the name code: hello.c). How does your program work?-  It turns out that the code: get_string function is really not that different than the code: get_int function that we
Response: -  The string is then stored in a variable called code: answer of type string. Note that all variables have a type, in this case “string”, and have a name, in this case “answer”.  -  When printing the string with the code: printf function, you tell C that the string code: answer should be printed in the output. This is done by placing %s inside the double quotes of your string.  -  Try running your program and see what it does. Try changing the code: printf statement and observe the different outputs.  -  Take some time to try different programs that ask the user for different inputs. Remember the different types of variables and how to initialize them.

Prompt: -  The code: get_string function returns a value of type string, which is a data type that we have not seen before.  -  The code: string answer = get_string("What's your name?"); statement declares a variable called answer of type string and assigns it the string that the user types in response to the prompt “What’s your name?”.  -  The code: printf("hello, %s \n", answer); statement is similar to the printf statement you’ve seen in Scratch. The string hello, %s \n is printed to the terminal window, with %s replaced by the value of answer, which is the user’s name. The
Response: -  Let’s take a closer look at the code: string answer = get_string("What's your name?"); statement. First, note that the data type of the answer variable is string. Second, note that the string that the user types in response to the prompt “What’s your name?” is assigned to the answer variable.  -  Finally, note that in the code: printf("hello, %s \n", answer); statement, the string hello, %s \n is printed to the terminal window, with %s replaced by the value of answer, which is the user’s name.  -  The statement of code is closed with a code: ;. A

Prompt: -  The %s in the code: printf function is called a code: format specifier. This is a placeholder for a string that is going to be printed. The code: answer variable immediately after the comma (,) is the string that will be printed in the %s’s place.  -  In your terminal window, run code: make hello. Typing code:./hello in the terminal window, what does your program do now?  -  Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? "
Response: -  Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );printf ( "hello, %s \n " ,answer );}  In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will notice something strange. The output of your program is not as you may have expected. Try running the program again.  -  Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>

Prompt: -  Try running code: make hello and then code: ./hello in the terminal window. Try typing your name in.-  What happens if you type in a number? Can you explain why?  -  Modify your program so it only says hello if the input is a string (i.e. not a number). Your code should look like the following:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );if  ( answer  !=  NULL )  { printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );}}  Notice the
Response: -  Notice also the code: string keyword has been used. This is a type of variable. In C, we have to be explicit about the types of data we are storing. In this case, we are storing a string.  -  Try compiling your code and then running code: ./hello.   -  Notice that if you type in your name, the program will say hello, but if you type in a number, it crashes and reports an error. This is because C is a very explicit language. C is not very forgiving of errors.  -  To fix this problem, we can do two things. We can modify our program to check if the user entered a string and if not, to ask them to try again

Prompt: -  Try running code: ./hello in your terminal window. What does your program do? -  What happens if you don’t use the code: \n at the end of your code: printf statement? Try it!  -  What happens if you change the code: string answer = get_string ( "What's your name? " );statement to the following: int answer = get_string ( "What's your name? " );?  -  Try it! What error message do you get?  -  Fix your program so that it looks as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {
Response: -  The code: string answer = get_string ("What's your name? "); command does two things:  -  First, it declares a variable called code: answer.  -  Second, it assigns a string value to the variable code: answer, getting it from the user by calling the code: get_string function.  -  The code:  printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );command is used to print a string out to the terminal. The code: %s is a placeholder for the code: answer variable. When the program is run, the code: %s will be replaced with the actual variable code: answer. The code: \n is used to print a newline

Prompt: -  <cs50.h> also provides a function, code: get_int, for getting an integer from the user.-  Run your program by executing code: make hello. You should be able to type into the terminal window and see what you type echoed back to you.  -  When you are finished, type code: Control-c to quit your program and get back to the terminal.-  Try running your program without the semicolon on the last line. What happens?-  When you are finished, add the semicolon back to the end of your code and type code: Control-c to quit your program and get back to the terminal.## More Variables  - Modify your code as follows
Response: -  Notice they way we declared a string variable called code: answer.  -  In the code: printf function, we have included code: %s. This means that the code: printf function will print the string variable code: answer.-  Execute your program by typing code: ./hello in the terminal window.  -  Try changing the code: get_string function to code: get_int function. How does this change the behavior of your program?-  Try changing the print statement to code: printf ( "hello, %i \n ",answer );-  Finally, try changing the print statement to code: printf ( "hello, %c \n ",answer );-  When you are finished, change

Prompt: -  Run your program and you will be asked for your name. Type your name and press Enter. You should see your program echo back to you with “hello,” and your name appended to it.  -  Try changing the string in the code: printf function to something else, like code: "%s is awesome" and run your program again.  -  Try changing the string in the code: printf function to something else, like code: "%s is awesome".  -  Try changing the string in the code: printf function to something else, like code: "%s is awesome!"  -  Try changing the string in the code: printf function to something else, like code: "%s is awesome
Response: -  The code: string answer = get_string("Whats your name? "); stores the string that the user types in into the variable code: answer. The name of the variable is completely up to you! You could have named it something different like code: s or code: y.  -  The code: printf("hello, %s \n",answer); prints out the string hello, followed by a space, and then the string that is stored in code: answer.  -  Try running your program and see how it behaves!  -  Try changing the string that gets stored in the code: answer variable.  -  Try changing the string that is printed out.  -  Try changing the variable

Prompt: - Notice also that we have introduced a new keyword called code: string. This keyword is used to represent text in C.  -  In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will now be met with numerous errors! Placing the semicolon back in the correct position and running code: make hello again, the errors go away.- Notice also the special symbol code: \n in your code. Try removing those characters and making your program again by executing code: make hello. Typing code:./hello in the terminal window, how did your program change?  -  Restore your program to the following:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int
Response: -  Running the program with code: make hello should compile without errors.  -  Note: The code: string type is one of C’s primitive types, which means it is one of the basic types that C supports. But by including the code: cs50.h library, we have additional types that we can use, including code:string. It is important to note that C is case-sensitive, meaning that code: string is the same as code: String.  -  For the purposes of this course, we will use the code: string type.  -  The code: get_string function returns a code: string to the code: answer variable.  -  Notice also the special symbol %s

Prompt: -  The line of code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); defines a new variable called answer, which is of the type string, and assigns it the value returned by the code: get_string function.  -  The line of code: printf("hello, %s \n", answer); prints hello and then the value of the answer variable, followed by a new line.-  Try running your program and see what it does.-  Did you notice anything different when you ran your program?-  Try changing the string that you print to something else.
-
What is the difference between the semicolon and the comma in C programming?
Response: -  What if we wanted to say hello multiple times? We could add an extra line of code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );} Try running this program and see what it does.- What if we wanted to say hello many times? Try changing the code: printf statement to the following:code: printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );hello, worldhello, worldhello, world

Prompt: -  Because C is a statically typed language, we need to explicitly tell the program that the value we are getting from the user is of type code: string. A string is just an array of characters, which we will discuss in more detail in a bit.  -  Running code: make hello again and code: ./hello, you should now be able to enter in your name and have it printed back to you in the terminal window.  -  Try changing the word “hello” in your program to “goodbye”. Notice how the output changes when you run the program.  -  Now modify your program again so that instead of saying “hello” to the user, you say “
Response: -  Running code: make hello again will compile your program and allow you to test it out.  -  Try editing your code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );}  Notice code: printf("hello, %s \n", answer); has been duplicated. Try running your program (code: ./hello) and notice what happens.  -  In the printf statement, notice the code: %s character. This is called a format

Prompt: -  The output of this program will be exactly the same as Scratch. Try it out!-  In C, variables are declared with a type. The type of a variable determines how much memory is allocated for that variable and what kind of data can be stored in it. In the above program, a string variable named code: answer was declared with the type code: string.  -  C has the following types:  -  type: int  -  stores an integer value  -  type: float  -  stores a floating-point value  -  type: char  -  stores a character value  -  type: string  -  stores a sequence of characters  -  type: bool  -
Response: -  The string is stored in a variable named answer.   -  The code: %s tells the code: printf function to print whatever string is stored in answer.  -  The code: get_string function is not part of the standard C library.  -  The code: %s is called a format specifier. It tells the code: printf function what kind of data to expect.  -  There are many other format specifiers. Try the following code:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "

Prompt: - If you run your program now, you will notice that it doesn’t work! That’s because there is no semicolon after the code: get_string function. Add the semicolon, re-run your program, and you should see it work as expected.  -  Try running your program multiple times, and you will notice that the name you input is always stored in the code: answer variable.-  What if we wanted to ask the user “What is your age?” and have the program say “You are X years old” where X is their age? We can do this by storing the age in another variable called code: age. Modify your code as follows:
Response: -  The string is stored in the variable called answer. The code: printf function is used to print to the screen. Notice that the 2nd parameter of the printf function is a variable called answer surrounded by code: %s. This tells printf to print the string stored in answer variable to the screen. -  What if instead of printing the string with the hello message, we wanted to print the length of the string. We can do this by using a special function from the cs50 library called code: strlen. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h> #include  <string.h>   int  main ( void )  {

Prompt: - Try running code: ./hello again. You should see that your program now behaves similarly to how your Scratch program did.- Try changing the word “hello” in your program to some other word. How did your program change?- In C, we can also ask the user for a number. Modify your program as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  age  =  get_int ( "What's your age? " );printf ( "You are at least %i years old. \n ",age * 365 );}  Notice the code: int data type has been used to
Response: -  The line of code: string answer = get_string ( "What's your name? " ); creates a new variable called answer that is initially set to the string returned by the code: get_string function.  - The printf function is now being called with two arguments. The first argument is the string that will be printed, and the second argument is the string to be replaced in each %s.  -  Try running your program. You should see that it behaves similarly to the Scratch program you made.-  Try changing the word “hello” in your program to some other word. How did your program change?  -  Try adding more than one mention of %s in your program (a.k

Prompt: -  Also notice that a C programming concept called a code: variable has been introduced. You can think of a code: variable as a “box” in which you can “stuff” some data. In this case, we’ve created a code: variable called code: answer, which we can then use in the code: printf function to say “hello” with that user’s name appended to it.

-
-The stdio.h library is a standard library that is included with every C compiler, while the cs50.h library is specific to CS50

Prompt: -  By running code: make hello, you can compile your program and then run code: ./hello to actually run it.-  Notice that when you run your program, you might not see the question appear until you hit return. This is because the code: get_string function is waiting for the return key to be pressed before it returns the string that you typed in.  -  It is also important to notice that the string you type in (in response to the question) is stored in the variable called code: answer. You can then refer to this variable by name in the call to code: printf.  -  You can also modify your program to ask the user a question and save their answer in a variable called code:
Response: -  Notice that the string that we get from the user is stored in the code: answer variable.  -  The statement of code is closed with a code: ;.- A common error in C programming is the omission of a semicolon. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " )  printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );}  Notice the semicolon is now gone.- In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will now be met with numerous errors!

Prompt: -  Also notice the code: string answer = get_string( "What's your name? " ); . This line of code is called a code: declaration. It declares a code: string variable called code: answer and assigns the code: get_string function to it.  -  Notice code: %s in the code: printf function. This is called a code: placeholder. The code: answer variable will be placed where that placeholder is.  -  Try running your program without the semicolon at the end of the code: string answer = get_string( "What's your name? " ); line. What happens?-  Can you figure out what the following lines of code do?int  age
Response: -  Also notice the following lines:  -  string answer = get_string( "What's your name? " );  -  printf ( "hello, %s \n ", answer );  -  The first line declares a code: string variable called code: answer. This is done by including the keyword code: string followed by the name of the variable. The second line uses the code: printf function to say hello to the user and use the code: answer variable as the name to say hello to.-  Try running your program. In your terminal window, type code: ./hello. What happens?-  Can you figure out what the following lines of code do?int  age;  age =  get_

Prompt: -  In order to store this string, we need to define a code: string variable that we have creatively called answer. The code: %s in code: printf tells C to print the string stored in code: answer.  -  If you run code: make hello and then code: ./hello, you should get the same result as you did in Scratch.  -  Try changing the code: printf function to the following:code: printf ( "hello, %s... I mean %s \n ",answer,answer );  -  Now type code: make hello and code: ./hello again. How did your program change?  -  We can also ask the user for numbers. Modify your code as
Response: -  Let’s go ahead and try to build your code: make hello and execute code: ./hello. You should now be able to type in your name and get a response.  -  The information that you have just captured from your user, a string in this case, is temporarily stored in the code: answer variable.  -  We can also ask the user for a number. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );int

Prompt: -  The code: string data type is a data type unique to the CS50 library. It’s a data type that allows us to store strings (i.e. text). We also use the keyword code: int to declare that the answer variable is of type integer.-  Try running your program again by typing code:./hello in the terminal window. How did your program change?  -  What happens if you change code: string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );to this?code: int  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );-  How did your program change?  -  What happens if you change code:

" );printf ( "hello, %

Prompt: -  Try running your code: make hello; ./hello in the terminal window. You should be prompted with “What’s your name?”. Type in a name and hit enter. You should see hello, [name] printed out!-  What is the difference between the following two pieces of code?code:     printf ( "hello, %s \n ", get_string ( "What's your name" ));     string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );  The first piece of code is an example of code: function chaining. The output of code: get_string ("What’
Response: The code: string answer is a variable declared as a string. The code: = assigns the value of code: get_string to the variable code: answer. The code: printf function now takes two parameters, the first is the string to print, and the second is the variable code: answer.-  Try running your code: make hello; ./hello in the terminal window.-  Notice that the %s in the code: printf command is a placeholder for the variable code: answer. Try changing the statement to the following and run your code again:  code: printf ( "hello, %s, how are you? \n ",answer );  -  Notice that the question mark has been removed from the code: get_string

Prompt: -  Compiling and running your program, you should see that it behaves similarly to what you did in Scratch.  -  Type code: man get_string to read about the get_string function.  -  Also, type code: clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50 to compile your program.

What is the purpose of the semicolon in C programming?
Response: -  The code: %s is a placeholder for a string that we will insert later.  -  This code code: string  answer =  get_string  ( "What's your name? " ); is creating a new variables called answer that is of type string. This means that the answer can be any set of characters. The code: get_string function is used to get a string from the user. The get_string function will save the user’s input into this answer variable.  -  Now, run code: make hello again in your terminal window. You should get no errors.  -  Run code: ./hello in your terminal window.  -  Type in your name and press enter.

Prompt: -  If you now run code: make hello, you should see that your program compiles without any errors and when you run code: ./hello, you are prompted for your name.  -  What happens if you now try running code: ./hello 42? Try it out!-  We can do something similar with numbers. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  age  =  get_int ( "How old are you? " );printf ( "I am also %i years old. \n ",age );} -  Run code: make hello. You should
Response: -  The type string is a data type. This is a new concept. A data type is a way to represent some value in your program. In this case, the program can now store a string of text.- The program will store this string of text in a location in memory called answer. The code: = is an assignment operator. This means that the value of code: get_string is stored in the location named code: answer.  -  The code: printf function is a way of printing something to the screen. Again, this is a function that is available because of the code: #include <stdio.h> statement. The %s is a special character that tells the code: printf function to print the value

Prompt: -  The variable code: answer is used to store the user’s input. The code: printf function is then used to print out code: "hello, %s \n",answer. The %s is called a format specifier. It’s telling the printf function that the string stored in answer should be printed at that location.  -  Try running make hello and then ./hello to test your code.-  What do you think would happen if you changed the code: get_string function to code: get_int? How would the program change? Try it out!-  What do you think would happen if you changed the code: get_string function to code: get_float? How would the
Response: -  As with the last program, we’re using a format specifier (code: %s) to insert the string into the code: printf function. Try running code: make hello and then code: ./hello.  -  What do you think would happen if you changed the code: get_string function to code: get_int? How would the program change? Try it out!-  What do you think would happen if you changed the code: get_string function to code: get_float? How would the The statement of code is closed with a code: ;.-  A common error in C programming is the omission of a semicolon. Modify your code as follows:code: #include

Prompt: -  The type of the answer variable is string. In C, all data types (e.g. int, char, string, etc.) must be declared before they can be used. This is similar to how we declared variables in Scratch.-  The code: %s is a placeholder for our variable answer. The printf command will automatically print the string at answer’s location in memory.  -  Execute code: make hello in your terminal window. After the program compiles, type code: ./hello in the terminal window to run your program. You should see something similar to the following output:Output:$ ./helloWhat's your name? Davidhello, David-  Try changing the string in your code to
Response: -  Notice also that we now have a new type of variable called code: string. A string is a sequence of characters. It is similar to the list data type in Scratch.-  Notice also that we are now using the code: %s placeholder in our printf function. This placeholder is replaced with the value of our string variable answer.-  Execute code: make hello in your terminal window. After the program compiles, type code: ./hello in the terminal window to run your program. You should see something similar to the following output:Output:$ ./helloWhat's your name? Davidhello, David-  Try changing the string in your code to The statement of code is closed with a code: ;.-  A

Prompt: What's the difference between the stdio library and the cs50 library?
Response: -  In order to use this function, we have to have a place to store the string, so we have declared a variable code: answer of type code: string. ## Strings  - In C, there is no built-in string data type. The C programming language doesn’t care what you type. It only cares about the characters and numbers you type. So, we have to create our own string data type!-  In order to do this, we use an array of characters, which is just a sequence of characters. We also need to specify the length of this array. A common length to use is 50 characters. So, we can declare a string like this:code: char  answer [50];

Prompt: - The code: %s is a placeholder for a string. When the program is run, the string code: answer is inserted into the code: %s placeholder and the user sees: hello, [person’s name]  -  Add the following two lines of code to your program:code: int  age  =  get_int ( "How old are you? " );printf ( "You are at least %i days old. \n ",age * 365 );  -  Here, we are introducing the concept of variables. A variable is a place in memory where you can store data. The code: int age is telling the compiler that we want to create a variable called code: age that can store an
Response: -  In C, strings are stored in a special data type called a code: string. You can also store integers and floating point numbers in C using the code: int and code: float data types, respectively.  -  One of the challenges in using C is that you must describe the data types of all variables explicitly. This is done using the code: string, code: int, and code: float notation, as shown above.-  The code: string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " ); is called a code: declaration statement. The code: string data type tells the compiler that you want to create a variable that can store text, in this case, a user’s

Prompt: -  Another way of thinking about a string is to think of it as an array of characters. The length of the string is the number of characters in that array. The following code counts the number of characters in a string:code: #include <cs50.h> #include <stdio.h>   int main ( void ) { string s = get_string ( "Enter a string: " ); int n = 0 ; while ( s [ n ] != '\0' ) { n ++ ; } printf ( "Length of %s : %i \n", s , n ); return 0 ; } - The code: \0 is a special character that denotes the end of a string. This means that if
Response: - Try running your program (by executing code: make hello in the terminal).  -  Try running your program with additional input (by executing code: ./hello <additional inputs> in the terminal).  -  Try running your program without any input (by executing code: ./hello <no inputs> in the terminal).  -  Try running your program with a very long input (by executing code: ./hello <very long input> in the terminal).  -  Try running your program with a negative input (by executing code: ./hello <negative input> in the terminal).  -  Try running your program with an input that is not a number (by executing code: ./hello <input that is not a number

Prompt: -  Try running your program by entering  code: ./hello in the terminal window. What happens?  -  In your terminal window, try running  code: clang hello.c -o hello. This will compile your program but with some additional warnings.-  In your terminal window, try running  code: clang -Wno-deprecated-declarations hello.c -o hello. This will compile your program but without any additional warnings.-  In your terminal window, try running  code: clang -Wall hello.c -o hello. This will compile your program but with even more additional warnings!  -  Modify your program as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #
Response: -  The code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");  is known as an assignment statement. The part on the left (code: string answer) is known as a variable. The part on the right (code: get_string("What's your name? ")) is known as a value.-  The first part of the assignment statement (code: string answer) tells the computer that you want to assign the value on the right side of the assignment statement to a variable called code: answer. The word code: string is known as the type of the variable. The word code: answer is known as the identifier of the variable.  -  The second part of the assignment statement (code:

Prompt: -  The code: string answer = get_string ( "What's your name? " ); saves the user’s response in the string variable called code: answer.-  The code: printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer ); prints the string code: hello, and then replaces code: %s with the value in the code: answer variable. Notice that there is a space between the two characters code: , and code: %s. This is because we want a space between the word code: hello and the user’s name. The semicolon ; ends the statement.-  The \n is a special character that moves the cursor to the next line.-  In your terminal window, type code
Response: -  The code: string answer = get_string ( "What's your name? " ); saves the user’s response in the string variable called code: answer.-  The code: printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer ); prints the string code: hello, and then replaces code: %s with the value in the code: answer variable. Notice that there is a space between the two characters code: , and code: %s. This is because we want a space between the word code: hello and the user’s name. The semicolon ; ends the statement.  -  The \n is a special character that moves the cursor to the next line.  -  The following characters

Prompt: -  Try running code: ./hello again in the terminal. You should see that you are prompted for your name and when you type it in, it is printed out to the terminal.-  Now that we have a way to get information from the user, we can start to do some more interesting things. 

What is the difference between the stdio.h and cs50.h libraries?
Response: -  The code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); stores the result of the get_string function into a variable called code: answer.  -  The code: printf("hello, %s \n",answer ); prints out hello, code: answer followed by a newline. The special code: %s is a place holder for the string variable code: answer. The code: \n is used to place a newline character in the string.-  In your terminal, run code: make hello and then run code: ./hello to see your program in action.  -  With variables, we now have the ability to store data in memory and access it later. 

What

Prompt: -  Try running the code: ./hello in your terminal window. What happens? Does it work as expected?-  What happens if you change code: string answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " ); to code: int answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " ); ?  -  What happens if you change code: int answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " ); to code: float answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " ); ?  -  What happens if you change code: float answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " ); to code: char answer
Response: -  The code: printf function is used to print out strings. You can read about all the capabilities of the printf function on the Manual Pages.- When running your program (type code: ./hello), you will notice the question is asked and the output is displayed on an entirely different line. This is because a newline is added to the end of the string code: What's your name? code: \n  -  There are ways to get around this and add the question and answer on the same line. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_

Prompt: - The code: get_string function is used to get a string from the user. The code: string answer is a variable. A variable is a place in memory that stores some data. You can name this variable anything you want. We chose the name code: answer, but you could have named it code: myname or code: x.- We now use the code: printf function to print the string hello, and the value of the code: answer variable. The value of the code: answer variable is represented in our code as %s. This is called a format specifier and it tells the code: printf function that the next argument, or value, should be interpreted as a string.  -  If we wanted to print
Response: -  The code: string answer is a variable. A variable is a place in memory that stores some data. You can name this variable anything you want. We chose the name code: answer, but you could have named it code: myname or code: x.- We now use the code: printf function to print the string hello, and the value of the code: answer variable. The value of the code: answer variable is represented in our code as %s. This is called a format specifier and it tells the code: printf function that the next argument, or value, should be interpreted as a string.  -  If we wanted to print The statement of code is closed with a code: ;.-  A common error

Prompt: -  Notice that we have also defined a code: string variable called code: answer. The code: %s is a “formatting string” that tells C that the following variable, code: answer, is a string that should be printed. -  In your terminal window, run code: clang -o hello hello.c  -  Then, execute your program by running code: ./hello. How did your program change?-  Now that we have the ability to store a string in a variable, let’s store an integer. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )
Response: -  Notice also the code: string variable called code: answer. A string variable is just a variable that contains a piece of text.  -  When you ask the user for a string, that string is stored in the variable called code: answer. -  The code: %s tells C that the variable that follows, code: answer, is a string that should be printed.  -  In your terminal window, run code: clang -o hello hello.c  -  Then, execute your program by running code: ./hello. What happened?-  When your program executes, you may notice that the cursor does not move. This is because the code: get_string function is waiting for you to type something

Prompt: -  In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will now be met with numerous errors! These errors come from the fact that you have not told the program what a string is. You can do so by declaring the type of the variable code: answer as a string. This is accomplished with the following code:string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );- Now, run code: make hello again. You will notice that the errors go away.- Typing code:./hello in the terminal window, how did your program change?  -  What happens if you try to store an integer in a string variable? What error message do you get?-  What happens if you
Response: -  The value returned by code: get_string is stored in the string variable code: answer. Notice that the string variable code: answer is declared after the code: main function.  -  Also notice that the code: printf function prints out the string code: hello, %s \n, where %s is replaced by the value of code: answer, which is the value returned by code: get_string.  -  It is important to note that the code: printf statement is closed with a code: ;.  -  In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will now be met with numerous errors! These errors come from the fact that you have not told the program what a string is.

Prompt: - Try running your program now by executing code: ./hello in your terminal window. What happens?  -  Now try running your program again, but this time, add a space and then your name after code: ./hello. For example, if your name were Alice, you would type code: ./hello Alice in your terminal window. How did your program change?  -  To get a better understanding of what is going on here, let’s add some more code to our program. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "
Response: -  The statement  code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); declares a variable called code: answer of type code: string. The code: get_string function outputs a string that is assigned to code: answer. The statement  code: printf(“hello, %s\n”, answer); outputs the Hello statement followed by the value stored in code: answer.  -  In your terminal window, run code: make hello.  -  Now enter code: ./hello in your terminal window.  -  Enter your name when prompted.  -  How did your program change?  -  Try changing the first line of your code to the following:code: #

Prompt: -  Notice also the code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");. This is called a variable declaration. The keyword code: string is the data type of the variable. The keyword code: answer is the name of the variable and code: get_string("What's your name? ") is the value of the variable.  -  Data types allow us to specify what type of data a particular variable will hold.-  The following is a list of data types that you can use in C.-  char: A single byte of data. Can store a letter, number, or symbol.-  int: A whole number between -2147483648 and 2147483647.-  float
Response: -  Run code: make hello.c and then ./hello in your terminal window. You should see:  ``` What's your name?  ```  -  Type your name in the terminal window and press return/enter. You should see:  ``` hello, [your name] ```  -  Let’s explore some of the other capabilities of the cs50 library. Read about get_int and get_float by executing code: man get_int and code: man get_float in your terminal window.  -  Modify your program as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )

Prompt: -  A string is a sequence of characters. To the right of code: get_string, add a space and the following: What's your name?. This is called an  argument. The argument is what the user will see when the program runs. It’s called an  argument because it’s an input to the code: get_string function.  -  The code: get_string function returns a string, which is a sequence of characters. That string is stored in the string  variable called  answer .  -  Notice the semicolon at the end of the line code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");. The semicolon is a statement termin
Response: -  The code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); creates a new variable called  answer . This variable is of type  string .  -  The code: printf("hello, %s \n",answer); prints the string “hello,” followed by the value of  answer , followed by a new line character. The code: %s is a placeholder for a string.  -  Notice how the semicolon is needed at the end of all of the lines of code within the main function.  -  You can also ask the user for other types of input. Try modifying your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include

Prompt: -  The code: string variable type is used to store the string value that the user inputs. The code: %s is a placeholder for the string that will be printed out.- In your terminal window, run code: make hello. You will now be met with numerous errors! Placing the semicolon back in the correct position and running code: make hello again, the errors go away.- Notice also the special symbol code: \n in your code. Try removing those characters and making your program again by executing code: make hello. Typing code:./hello in the terminal window, how did your program change?  -  Restore your program to the following:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include

Prompt: - Try running your program by executing code: make hello in the terminal window and then code: ./hello.  -  What happens now when you type code: ./hello in the terminal window?-  When you write code, you can make comments by starting a line with two slashes code: //. These lines are ignored by the computer, but they are useful for other humans who might read your code.  - Modify your code as follows, adding a comment:code: // Asks the user for their name, and then says hello to them!#include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get
Response: - Try running your program with the code: make hello command. After the program compiles, type code: ./hello in the terminal window.  -  Now, let’s make the program a bit more interesting. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %s \n ",answer );int  length  =  strlen ( answer );printf ( " %i is the length of your name. \n ",length );}  -  Notice how in C you

Prompt: - The code: printf function allows us to print out a string to the terminal.  -  If you run code:make hello again and execute code:./hello from the terminal, you will notice that our program still doesn’t quite work as we intended.  -  The reason is that we have not yet stored the user’s response in a place where we can access it. In C, we store data in something called a variable.  -  To fix our program, modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What
Response: The string is then stored in a variable called answer. The %s is a special placeholder that allows us to insert a string into the code: printf function.  -  We can also use the %d placeholder to insert an integer into the code: printf function. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, %d \n ",  get_int ( "What's your age? " ));}  Here we are utilizing the code: get_int function which allows us to get an integer from the user.  -  In general, C is a very powerful programming

Prompt: Also, notice that the code: %s in the code: printf function. This is called a format specifier and it tells printf that the next argument in the list that follows is going to be a string.  In your terminal window, execute code: make hello. Notice there are no errors. Type code: ./hello in your terminal window and you should see something similar to the following:  -  What's your name? David  -  hello, David-  Recall that in Scratch, we created a variable to keep track of the user’s score.  -  In C, we can do the same. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include
Response: Also notice that the code: %s in the code: printf function. This is called a format specifier and it tells printf that the next argument in the list that follows is going to be a string.

David  -  hello, David-  Recall that in Scratch, we created a variable to keep track of the user’s score.  -  In C, we can do the same. Modify your code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include

Prompt: -  Notice also the symbol code: %s in the second line of code. This is called a format specifier. It tells the code: printf function that the next argument (answer) is of type string and that it should print it in the spot where the code: %s is.-  Try running code: make hello and ./hello in the terminal window. You should now be able to say hello with your name!-  Variables in C can have any name you want (within reason).  -  Try changing the name code: answer to code: username in your code and make your program again. How did your program change?## More Format Specifiers  -  Format specifiers can be used to print more than
Response: -  The code: string is a new data type and is used to store a string.  -  The equal sign code: = is used to assign a value. So code: string answer = get_string( "What's your name? " ); says: “create a new variable called code: answer and assign it the value that is returned by the code: get_string function.”  -  The code: get_string function will print code: What’s your name? to the terminal window and wait for the user to type something.-  The variable code: answer has been passed to the code: printf function.  -  The code: %s in the code: printf function tells it

Prompt: -  The variable code: answer has been declared as a string type.  -  The special characters code: %s at the end of the code: printf function tells the program to print the variable code: answer.  -  The statement code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); assigns the user’s response to the variable code: answer.-  Try running your program again.  -  Notice that you need to press the return or enter key after typing your response to the program.

Prompt: -  If you execute code: make hello, you will now see a new warning message:code: hello.c:4:13: warning: implicit declaration of function 'get_string' is invalid in C99 [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]    string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );  ~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  -  The warning is telling you that the compiler doesn’t know where the code: get_string function is located.  -  Execute code: clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50 to compile your code and create an executable file called code: hello.  -  Executing code: ./hello
Response: -  The code: string is a data type in C. The letter “s” is chosen because it stands for “string”.  -  The code: answer is a variable. The name of the variable is arbitrary. It only needs to be meaningful so you can remember what the variable stands for.  -  The code: get_string function is also a function. This is a built-in library function.  -  The code: printf function is a built-in library function. This function allows you to print to the screen.  -  The code: %s is a placeholder. This is where the code: string data that is stored in the code: answer variable will be printed.

Prompt: - The code: string keyword is a data type that we are defining. More precisely, it is a data type that we are defining to be synonymous with code: char*.  -  The symbol code: %s is a placeholder for a string. After the comma, notice that the variable code: answer is listed. This is because the string that the user types will be stored in the code: answer variable.  -  After the semicolon, the code: printf function is used to print a string to the screen. The string that is printed is “hello,” concatenated with the string stored in the code: answer variable.  -  Now that you have defined a string variable, try adding other types
Response: -  It is also very important to read the comments in your code. The comment code: // What's your name? is how you add comments in C.  -  It is very important to write good comments. When you have to maintain code that you wrote a long time ago, you will have a much easier time doing so if you have written detailed comments.  -  Try running code: make hello now.  -  When you run code: ./hello, you will be asked “What’s your name?” When you type in your name, the terminal window will say “hello” and your name!  -  Try running the program a few times, adding more and more comments.

Prompt: - The code: %s is a placeholder for a string.  -  Run your program now by typing code: ./hello. Try it a few times, each time providing a different name as input.  -  When you’re satisfied, move on to the next task.

What is a variable in C programming?
Response: -  The statement code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); declares a variable called answer of type string and assigns to it the value returned by the function code: get_string.-  Notice that the code: printf function now accepts a new placeholder %s which will be replaced with the value of the string stored in the answer variable.  -  Remember to also include a space after the code: %s placeholder to make sure the text isn’t immediately next to the output of the string stored in the answer variable.  -  Try running your program again. Provide your name as input. What happens?  -  Try the following:code: #include  <cs50.h>

Prompt: What is the difference between the cs50.h and stdio.h libraries?
Response: -  When you compile your code by typing code: make hello in the terminal window and then execute it by typing code: ./hello, what happens?-  Try the following code and see what happens:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  answer  =  get_string ( "What's your name? " );printf ( "hello, %i \n ",answer );}  How does your program change? How does the output of your program change?  -  What happened here? The code: get_string function returns a string that we save in the variable called answer. However, when we use

Prompt: What is the code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, world \n " );}  function?
Response: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, world \n " );}

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: The purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line is to import the printf function from the stdio library so that we can use it in our program.

Prompt: -What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?

This line tells the compiler to include the stdio.h header file. This header file contains the prototypes for the printf and scanf functions, which are used for input and output in C.
Response: This function will print out the text ‘hello, world’ on the screen. Further, the \n at the end of the string tells the computer to insert a newline between the end of this message and the beginning of the next message. This is the same as clicking the “enter” button on your keyboard.-  Optionally, we can also use the putchar function to display a single character on the screen. For example, putchar('a'); would display the character ‘a’ on the screen. We will not use putchar in this book, however, as it is much less versatile than printf.-  For example, we can use printf to display numbers as follows:code: #include

Prompt: What is the purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line of code?
Response: - The term code: argument refers to any value passed to a function. In this case, we are passing a string, or a set of characters.  - The term code: parameter refers to the specific name of the argument in the function definition. In this case, the parameter is called code: format. -  Let’s write a new program that displays how many letters are in a word.code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  letters = 5 ;  printf ( "There are %d letters in the word. \n " , letters );  return  0 ;}  -  In the first line, we are declaring a variable. The

Prompt: What is the purpose of a terminal window?
Response: A terminal window is a text-based window where users can type commands to perform various tasks.

Prompt: How do you write a program in C?
Response: - The code: \n is an escape sequence which tells the terminal to insert a new line character. In other words, it moves the cursor down one line.-  The printf function can actually display much more than just text. For example, consider the following modification to our program:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  x  =  5 ;  printf ( "%d \n " , x );}  Notice the usage of code: %d. This is a placeholder for an integer. The code: %d is replaced by the value of code: x, which is 5. Thus, our program displays code: 5.## Variables  -

Prompt: What is the difference between a file called hello.c and a file called hello?
Response: -  ‘\n’ is a character called a newline character. It tells the computer that we want to start on a new line.- The semicolon (;) at the end of a line of code is how C knows that a line of code has ended.
-
The difference between a file called hello.c and a file called hello is that hello.c is a source code file while hello is an executable file.

Prompt: What is a function?
Response: A function is a set of instructions that can be invoked by a name. Functions are written so that they can be used throughout a program, making the code more modular and efficient.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the terminal window?
Response: The purpose of the terminal window is to give the user access to the computer's command line interface (CLI). The CLI is a text-based interface that allows the user to enter commands, run programs, and perform other tasks. The terminal window is also where the user can view the output of their programs.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the text editor in the middle of the screen?
Response: In C, we must put code: ; at the end of every statement.

The text editor is used to write the code for the program. The terminal window is used to compile and run the program.

Prompt: Hello.c is a program that prints "Hello, world" to the terminal window.
Response: Further, the \n denotes a newline and is required to print hello, world on its own line.  Finally, notice that a semicolon (;) is used to denote the end of every statement in C.-  Let’s try this code:printf ( "hello \n " );printf ( "world \n " );printf ( " \n " );printf ( "hello, world \n " );Notice that, in the output window, the two separate printf calls create two separate lines in the terminal.  Further, notice that the \n characters are required to create a new line.-  Let’s try this code:printf ( "hello \n " );printf ( "world \n "

Prompt: What is the difference between a file called hello.c and a file called hello?
Response: This is a string, which is just text. The \n at the end of the string indicates a newline character, telling the computer to start a new line after printing the string.-  Now, let’s add some more functionality to our program. After the existing line of code, add the following line of code:code: printf ( "i am ready to learn c \n " );  Now, compile and run your code. You will see that the new line is printed on the screen!-  When we want to utilize the functionality of a function like printf, we first need to declare that we are using it. We do this by including a header file.-  There are many header files in C, each one

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> command?
Response: The purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> command is to include the contents of the header file stdio.h in the program. This header file contains definitions of functions and macros used in the input/output of the C program.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include  <stdio.h> line of code?
Response: The \n is an escape sequence that tells the terminal to start a new line.

The #include <stdio.h> line of code is used to include the standard input/output library in the program. This library contains functions such as printf, which is used to print text to the terminal.

Prompt: What is a function in C?
Response: A function is a set of code that performs a specific task. In C, we use functions to perform specific tasks that we may want to repeat throughout our program or that we may want to invoke at a later time. Functions are written so that they can be invoked (called) by other parts of our program.

Prompt: How does the printf function work in C?
Response: printf is a function that takes in a string as an argument and prints it to the screen. The string we passed in happens to be ‘hello, world\n’. The \n at the end of the string is an escape character that tells printf to print a new line after printing ‘hello, world’. 

You can also pass in other escape characters like \t for tab or \\ for backslash.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line of code?
Response: The code: \n at the end tells C to start a new line after printf is done printing.## Variables  -  To truly understand how to use C, we need to introduce variables. A code: variable is a value that can change throughout the execution of the program.-  To declare a variable, we use the following format:code: type var_name;For example, to declare a variable of type code: int named code: x, we write:code: int x;  -  Type is the type of data you want to store in the variable. For example, an code: int stores an integer value. We will discuss types later. 

The purpose of the #include <stdio.

Prompt: -What is the purpose of a CLI?
-How do you compile a program in a CLI?
-What is the difference between a file called hello.c and hello?
Response: A CLI is a command line interface, which is a text-based interface that is used to view, run, and edit files on a computer. To compile a program in a CLI, you type in the name of the compiler, followed by the name of the file you want to compile. The difference between a file called hello.c and hello is that hello.c is the source code for the program, while hello is the compiled program.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the CLI?
Response: -  Let’s break this down:code: printf is the name of the function. This is how we tell the computer which function we want to use. (There are many other functions in C!)code: "hello, world\n" is the argument that is being passed to the printf function. In this case, the argument is a string of characters (text).-  The newline character, code:\n, tells the terminal to start a new line after displaying the text. This is similar to pressing enter on a keyboard. The newline character is represented by two characters: a backslash followed by the letter n.  -  When we execute the program, we can see the result: code: hello

Prompt: -What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?

This line tells the compiler to include the stdio.h header file. This header file contains the declarations of the printf function.
Response: The ‘\n’ is an escape sequence telling the computer to put a newline after the string. This is how we tell the program to go to the next line.- Further, notice that the printf function is bookended by a parenthesis, ( and ). This is how we tell the compiler that we are invoking a function. The parentheses may contain arguments that we wish to pass to the function. In this case, we have one argument, ‘hello, world\n’.-  Now, let’s edit our program to print out code: hello, world! on two separate lines:code:-  Clicking back in the terminal window, you can compile your code by executing code: make hello. Notice

Prompt: What is the purpose of the '#include <stdio.h>' line of code?
Response: The '#include <stdio.h>' line of code includes the standard input/output header file. This header file contains the prototype for the printf function.

Prompt: How does the printf function work in C?
Response: - The quotation marks denote that this is a string of characters, and the \n is a newline character that tells the terminal to start a new line.- We call this a string literal. A string literal is a set of characters stored in memory that we can later print out.- It’s important to note that C is a statically typed language, meaning we have to tell the compiler exactly what type of data we are working with. This is different from Python, which is a dynamically typed language, meaning we don’t have to explicitly tell the Python interpreter what type of data we’re working with.  - For example, look at the following code:code: int  main ( void )  {  printf (

Prompt: -What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
-What does the code: int main(void) { ... } line mean?
-How would you print a different string using the printf function?
Response: This string is known as a string literal.  In C, a string literal is an array of characters.  It’s not just any old array though, it’s an array with a special property: it has a code: null terminator at the end of it that indicates the end of the string.  A code: null terminator is a fancy way of saying that the last character is equal to code: '\0'.  This is important because it allows us to use functions like code: strlen to determine the length of the string.  We don’t need to worry about adding a code: null terminator to our strings, it’s automatically added for us when we use string liter

Prompt: -What is the function of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
-What is the difference between code: hello.c and code: hello?
Response: The backslash is called an escape character and it is used for the newline command. You will almost always want to include this when you print.-  The printf function is an example of a function. A function is basically like a mini-program within a program. A function takes one or more arguments and can return a value. The printf function takes a string as an argument and returns an integer. The integer is the number of characters printed.- It is important to note that when we call a function, the code that is executed is not necessarily the code that we wrote. The reason for this is that the compiler is responsible for converting our C code into executable code. When we run the executable code, it will utilize the printf function that

Prompt: How do you say "hello, world" in C?
Response: -  The code: \n is a special character that tells the computer to start a new line. This is how we create multiple lines of output using printf.-  Finally, notice the two code: { … } curly braces. Everything between these curly braces is considered part of the function. In this case, the function is code: main.  -  In the next section, we will learn how to create our own functions.## Variables  -  In Scratch, we utilized the code: set block to store data. Indeed, in C, we utilize the concept of variables to store data for later use.-  For example, let’s store the number 5 in a variable called x:code: int  x

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: command line interface, known as a CLI,command line, or terminal window?
Response: The\n is an escape sequence that stands for a newline character, which tells the computer to move down to the next line before printing the rest of the text.-  Let’s break down our program:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, world \n " );}  -  The first line of code, code: #include  <stdio.h>, is a preprocessor directive. This line tells the compiler to go to the standard library and include the contents of stdio.h.-  The next line declares a function. A function is a set of instructions that perform a specific task. In this case, main is

Prompt: What is the difference between a file called hello.c and a file called hello?
Response: The \n is a newline character, which tells the terminal to start printing on a new line. 

A file called hello.c is a C programming file, while a file called hello is an executable file.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: The purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line is to include the header file stdio.h. This header file contains the declaration of the printf function.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: The purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line is to tell the compiler to include the standard input/output header file. This header file contains the prototype for the printf() function.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: #include <stdio.h> is a line of code that tells the compiler to include information about the standard library, a set of common functions used in C programs. This line of code must be included in every C program.

Prompt: -The \n at the end of the string is an escape sequence that tells printf to put a newline character at the end of whatever it just printed. This is how we can print multiple statements on separate lines.-  Let’s look at another example:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  x  =  5 ;  printf ( "x is equal to %d \n " ,  x );}  In the code above, we stored the value 5 in a variable called x. Then, we passed two arguments to the printf function. The first argument is a string that tells printf what to print. The %d is replaced by
Response: This is a string.-  Let’s go back to our original program:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  x  =  5 ;  printf ( "x is equal to %d \n " ,  x );}  In the code above, notice that we have a string as an argument, but also pass the code: x variable as an argument. This is because printf needs to know where in the string to insert our x variable. Indeed, the %d tells printf to insert the value stored in x in that location.  This is known as formatting a string. If you want to format a string, you must provide a format spec

Prompt: What is the purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line of code?
Response: -  ‘\n’ is called a newline character. This means that, once this line of text is displayed, the cursor should move down one line.
-

Prompt: What is the purpose of the '#include <stdio.h>' line of code?
Response: -  In addition, notice that the printf function is followed by a semicolon. This semicolon serves as the statement terminator in C. So far, we have only used one statement; however, we can have multiple statements on one line by separating them with semicolons. For example, the following program contains two statements:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, world \n " );  printf ( "goodbye, world \n " ); }  -  Let’s add a bit more code to our program. We will add comments to our program (comments are text that the computer ignores) and display the name of

-If the function requires arguments, they will be placed inside of the parentheses. 
-In this case, we only have one argument, but functions can have multiple arguments separated by commas.
-The semicolon at the end of the line is required.
-Every line of code in C must end with a semicolon.

What is the purpose of the semicolon at the end of every line of code in C?
Response: The purpose ofprintf is to print some text to the screen.  The \n in the code is an escape sequence that tells the computer to print a new line after displaying “hello, world”.-  In Scratch, we utilized the code: say block to display any text on the screen. Indeed, in C, we have a function called code: printf that does exactly this.-  Notice our code already invokes this function:code: printf ( "hello, world \n " );Notice that the printf function is called. The argument passed to printf is ‘hello, world\n’.  The purpose ofprintf is to print some text to the screen.  The \n in the code is an

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: -  The code: ‘\n’ is a special character that indicates a newline. This newline will cause the cursor to move down to the next line after the text is printed.-  There are many other functions in C, but we will only be discussing a few of them here.

Prompt: What is the difference between a file called hello.c and a file called hello?
Response: The difference between a file called hello.c and a file called hello is that hello.c is a C programming source code file while hello is an executable file.

Prompt: -  The code: printf function is a powerful function that can display many types of data on the screen. For example, we can display the code: value of variables using the code: %d format specifier:code: int  x  =  5 ; printf ( "x  is  %d \n " ,  x ); // prints: x is 5-  The code: %d is called a format specifier. The format specifier tells printf what type of data to expect inside the parentheses following printf. In this case, we are telling printf that we are passing in an code: int.  -  There are many other format specifiers:code: %c for code: char, %f for code
Response: -  The code: \n is an code: escape sequence. An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that does not represent itself when used inside a character or string literal. In this case, the code: \n is an escape sequence that stands for new line. Hence, the new line character is used here to print our statement on a new line.-  In fact, there are many other escape sequences. Here is a small subset of them:code:   -  Now, let’s write a program that tells us what time it is. Follow the steps above to create a new project and call it code time.c. Remember to include the code:.c extension. In the text editor, write code: the

Prompt: How do you say "hello, world" in C?

int main(void) {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

Prompt: What is the purpose of the '#include <stdio.h>' line of code?
Response: The purpose of the '#include <stdio.h>' line of code is to include the standard input/output header file. This header file contains functions such as printf and scanf that are commonly used in C programs.

Prompt: -What does the \n do in C?
Response: -  In C, strings are surrounded by double quotes.  -  Further, the backslash n character denotes a newline in a string. Consequently, our printf will print ‘hello, world’ followed by a newline.  -  You can invoke the printf function to print any string by placing the string within double quotes.  -  For example, you could print ‘hello, world’ followed by a newline by writing the following:code: printf ( "hello, world \n " );## Variables  - In earlier lessons, we talked about variables. In C, we can declare variables before our main function:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main

Prompt: How does the printf function work in C?
Response: ‘\n’ is a newline character, which tells the terminal to go to the next line.

The printf function in C is a function that outputs a formatted string to the standard output. The function takes a variable number of arguments, depending on the format string. The format string contains zero or more directives, which are either literal characters that are copied to the output stream, or character escape sequences that are interpreted according to the format string.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: The purpose of the line "#include <stdio.h>" is to tell the C compiler to include the contents of the stdio.h header file in the program. The stdio.h header file contains definitions of functions and macros used in the program.

#### Functions

- In Scratch, we utilized the `say` block to

Prompt: -What is the function of the "hello" program?

The "hello" program is a simple program that prints "Hello, world" to the screen.
Response: The code: \n at the end of the string is a special character that tells the computer to start a new line.  In other words, the computer will print hello, world on one line and then move to the next line.-  We can also use printf to display other types of data such as numbers.  For example, let’s display the number code: 5:code: printf ( " % d \n " , 5);  Notice that we first passed the string “%d\n” to printf. This string is known as a format string and is used to tell printf how to format its output.-  The code: %d is replaced with the value of the variable that follows it.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the "void" keyword in the main function declaration?
Response: We will visit what an argument is shortly, but for now, let’s study the function call. Notice the parentheses and semicolon. This is how we call functions in C.- Each function has a name and a list of parameters within the parentheses. In this case, printf has the name code: printf and the single parameter code: "hello, world \n".  - A parameter is a value that is passed to a function. In this case, a parameter ‘hello, world\n’ is passed to the printf function. The parameter can be a string, like we see here, or it could be an integer, double, character, etc.  - If a function requires multiple parameters, they are separated

Prompt: What is the difference between a file called hello.c and another file called hello?
Response: The actual output of our program will be code: hello, world with a new line afterwards.-  The new line is represented by the code: \n characters. When we invoke printf, we need to enclose our string in double quotation marks so that the compiler knows where the string ends.
-
A file called hello.c is a C programming source code file, while a file called hello is an executable file that has been created after compiling the hello.c file.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the '#include <stdio.h>' line of code?
Response: The '#include <stdio.h>' line of code is used to include the standard input/output header file. This header file contains functions such as printf and scanf that are used for input and output in C programs.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line in the code?
Response: The purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line in the code is to include the standard input/output library. This library provides functions for inputting and outputting data.

Prompt: How does the printf function work in C?
Response: The printf function prints the string of characters inside the quotation marks to the screen, and \n stands for newline. That is, after printf is executed, the next thing printed on the screen will appear on the next line down.

Prompt: What is the printf function in C?
Response: -  The term code: function is used in programming to describe a piece of code that can be executed over and over again.-  There are two types of functions: user-defined functions and built-in functions. User-defined functions are ones that you, the programmer, write. Built-in functions are ones that come with the language.-  In the remainder of this course, we will focus on user-defined functions. In this course, we will not focus on built-in functions.-  A function is executed by invoking it using its name followed by a pair of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we can pass in zero or more comma-separated arguments. These arguments are called parameters. For example:code: printf("hello

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: -  When the function is done executing, it will return to the calling code, which is main. Therefore, the program will end and you will be returned to the terminal.-  At this point, you should realize that the code: #include <stdio.h> line is required in any C program that uses the printf function. This is because the printf function is a library function that is not built into the language. Rather, it is built into the code: stdio library that we must explicitly include in our program.-  Let’s now examine the code: int main ( void ) { … } section of the code. The int keyword stands for integer. In C, every function must have a return type declared before

Prompt: What is syntax highlighting?
Response: Syntax highlighting is a feature of some text editors that displays text—especially source code—in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature eases scanning of the text and can help in finding errors.

Prompt: What does the '\n' do in printf("hello, world \n"); ?
Response: -  Try changing the text in the printf function, and re-compile your code. You should see the new text on the screen.  -  By the way, code: \n is equivalent to pressing the ‘enter’ key; as a result, it skips to the next line on the screen.-  Now, let’s write our own function.  -  Define a function that takes a name as an input and outputs the phrase “Hello, <name>”. For example, if I were to input the name “John”, the function should output “Hello, John”. You should also add a newline code: \n after the output.-

Prompt: What is the function of the code: #include <stdio.h> ?
Response: The function of the code is to include the standard input and output header file, which contains functions for input and output.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the keyword "void" in C programming?
Response: The code: \n is an escape sequence that tells printf to print a newline after it finishes printing the text.  The semicolon is used to signal the end of a statement. 

The purpose of the keyword "void" in C programming is to indicate that a function does not take any arguments.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code:./hello and your program will execute saying code: hello, world command?
Response: The purpose of the code "./hello and your program will execute saying hello, world" is to display text on the screen. The printf function is used to display text on the screen in C.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: The purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line is to include the header file stdio.h so that the compiler knows to look for the printf function in that file.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: -  When printf executes, it outputs ‘hello, world’ to the screen just like the code: say block in Scratch.



The purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line is to include the standard input/output library. This library provides functions for printing to the screen and reading from the keyboard.

Prompt: What is the purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line of code?
Response: This is a string. It is enclosed in double quotes. In C, text is called a string. 

The purpose of the #include <stdio.h> line of code is to include the standard input/output header file. This file contains information that is used by the printf function.

Prompt: -  In C, we must always end our lines with a semicolon (;). This is because each statement in C must end in a semicolon.

How do you print text to the screen in C?
Response: -  The printf function is not the only function, however, that we can utilize.  -  For example, if I wanted to display the result of adding 2 and 3, I could write:code: printf ( "2 + 3 = %d \n " ,  2  +  3 );Note that, in addition to the string, we are also passing the value 5, which is the result of 2 + 3.  -  Notice that we are using the code: %d format specifier. This is telling printf that we want an integer to be output.  -  Try changing the code to look like this:code: printf ( "2 + 3 = %f \n " ,  2  +

Prompt: What is syntax highlighting?
Response: ‘\n’ is an escape sequence that tells the computer to start a new line. This is similar to the code: Say block in Scratch.-  Let’s make our program say something else. Edit your program to look like the following:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "hello, world! \n " );}  Now, make and run your program. Notice that it says something different.## Variables  - In C, variables can store data. In Scratch, we used variables to store numbers, strings, and booleans. Similarly, C has variables that can store all of these data types. In C

Prompt: What is the purpose of the printf function in C?

Prompt: - 

What is the printf function?
Response: This means that we want to print out the text hello, world followed by a newline. Newlines are important in C. They signal the end of a command, similar to how pressing the enter key signals the end of a line in a word document. -  We can also invoke this function in the following way:code: printf ( "hello, world " );  printf ( "

" );  - 

The printf function is a function that allows you to print out text on the screen.

Prompt: How do you print a new line using the printf function in C?
Response: -  \n is what’s known as an escape sequence. It tells C that we want to print a newline character, which is the character that moves the text cursor to the beginning of the next line.- If we wanted to print multiple lines, we could use the printf function multiple times:code: printf ( "hello, world \n " );  printf ( "goodbye, world \n " );  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

Prompt: What is the purpose of the printf function?
Response: In C, we must always put our code: main function at the top of our file. After that, we can have any functions we like in any order. We will discuss functions in more detail later, but for now, know that they are like small programs that we can invoke from our code: main function.-  The code: \n is an escape sequence. It stands for “newline”, and it will cause our program to print a newline character after printing code: hello, world.


The printf function is used to print text to the screen.

Prompt: What is the difference between a function and a method?
Response: -  The function printf takes any number of arguments. In C, however, the number of arguments must match the number of format specifiers. A format specifier begins with a percent sign (%), followed by a character that represents the type of variable being passed. In this case, we use code: %s which represents a string.
-
A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. A method is a function that is associated with an object.

Prompt: What is the difference between the code: hello.c and code: hello file?
Response: The first character, the open parenthesis, indicates the beginning of the function invocation. The last character, the semicolon, indicates the end of the statement.-  In between these two characters is the function name and its arguments. The function name is code: printf and its single argument is the string of characters ‘hello, world\n’.## Variables  - The C programming language, like most modern programming languages, supports the use of variables. A variable is a container that stores a value. We can store any type of data in a variable. The value of a variable can be changed throughout the program.-  In fact, let’s store the string ‘hello, world\n’ in a

Prompt: What is the purpose of the code: #include <stdio.h> line?
Response: The #include <stdio.h> line allows us to use the printf function.

Prompt: What is the difference between code: hello.c and code: hello?

Response: - For this course, the file explorer will be the most important section.  -  The file explorer allows you to access files stored in your workspace.-  In this course, there will be two types of files: those you write and those you don’t.  -  Those you write are called source files. Source files are files containing code you write, often with a .c extension, which is the extension for the C programming language.  -  Those you don’t write are called header files. Header files are files containing code you don’t write but that are required for your source files to run. Header files often have a .h extension.-  In the middle of VS Code, there is an

Prompt: What is the machine code for "Hello World"?
Response: - The first program you will write will be a so-called *“Hello World”* program. This program is so called because it is the simplest program you can write in any programming language that will have an observable effect on the machine.- The goal of this program will be to have the machine print out the phrase “Hello, World!”.- The specific instructions for this program are as follows:  1. Open the file `hello.c`.  2. Write a program in C that prints out the phrase “Hello, World!” (without the quotes) followed by a newline (`\n`) and nothing more.  3. Save the file.  4. Compile the

This indicates to

Prompt: What is the difference between source code and machine code?
Response: - One of the most important files in every C program is called the main file. The main file contains a function called main. All C programs must have a main function. The main function is the program’s entry point. It is what is run first when the program starts.- Another important file is the header file. Like the name suggests, the header file contains headers, like a paper. The header file contains everything the program will need to compile correctly. There is a header file for every library you use. The standard library, which you will learn more about in a bit, has a header file called stdio.h.  - Finally, there is the source file, which is where the main function and everything else lives.

" )  if  ( c  ==  'Y'  ||  c  ==  'y' )  {  printf ( "Agreed. \n " )  }  }  Again, we are using the code: get_char function to get a character from the user. The user can type Y or y to indicate agreement.-  If you run code: make agree, followed by code: ./agree, you can try out your program.-

Prompt: -
-What does the %s do in the printf function?
Response: Then write code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  char  answer  =  get_char ( "Do you agree?\n " )  if  ( answer  ==  'Y' || answer == 'y')  {  printf ( "Agreed.\n " );}  else  if ( answer == 'N' || answer == 'n') {  printf ( "Not agreed.\n " );}  }  Note that we are using the get_char function.

Then

Prompt: Create a program that asks you to agree to a statement and either outputs 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.  If the user inputs any other character, the program should reprompt the user for valid input. Here is what your output should look like:code: Do you agree? (y/n) y You agreed! code: Do you agree? (y/n) n You did not agree. code: Do you agree? (y/n) maybe You did not agree.  Hint: You can use the code: get_char function to read a single character from the user.  You can also use the code: if...else if...else statement to handle the various outcomes.  Remember
Response: We can then code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  char  c  =  get_char ( "Do you agree?

Prompt: -  We can use constants to define how many blocks are printed. A constant is simply a name for a value that cannot be changed. For example, instead of using 3 in our code, we can use a constant named BLOCKS. This would look as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   #define BLOCKS 3  int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  BLOCKS ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  BLOCKS ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "#" );}  printf ( " \n " );}  }

Prompt: -  We would want to use constants in our solution to this problem. A constant is like a variable, except that once it is assigned a value, that value cannot be changed. In C, constants are declared using the keyword const.  -  For example, if we wanted to declare a constant called MAX that stores the value 4, we could write:code: const int MAX = 4;  -  We would then use this constant in our code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  MAX ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0
Response: -  We could declare a constant called BLOCKS, so that we can modify our code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   const int BLOCKS = 3 ;   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  BLOCKS ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  BLOCKS ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "#" );}  printf ( " \n " );}  }  Now, we are using the constant BLOCKS instead of the number 3. This means that if we wanted to change the number of blocks that are

Prompt: -  We can do so by declaring a constant variable at the top of our code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h> #define  N  3   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  N ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  N ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "#" );}  printf ( " \n " );}  }-  By declaring N to be 3, we ensure that regardless of how many times we run the code, three blocks will always be printed.-  How could we change this same code to print an

Prompt: To illustrate, look at the following line of code:code: // this is a comment  This comment is for the single line it appears on.  You may have noticed that such comments are gray in CS50 IDE, as opposed to the rest of your code, which is black.  This is a feature of CS50 IDE that makes it easy to quickly see which code is actual code, and which is comment.-  Another way to create a comment involves using code: /*  */.  This allows you to write comments that span multiple lines.  For example, look at the following code:code: /*  this is a comment that spans multiple lines  */  -  All code you create for this course must include robust comments

Prompt: - All characters to the right of the double slash will be ignored by the compiler.  - For example, consider the following code:code: int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "Hello, world!

" );  // print message}  The single line code: // print message is a comment. It will not affect the execution of the program, but it is helpful to remind you what that line of code is doing.  - We will often use comments to note TODO items: items that still need to be addressed within our code.  - For example, consider the following code:code: int  main ( void )  {  // TODO: prompt user for number}  In this case
Response: - For example, consider the following code:code: int  main ( void )  {  // TODO: prompt user for number}  The code: // TODO: prompt user for number is a comment.  - All characters to the right of the double slash will be ignored by the compiler.  - For example, consider the following code:code: int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "Hello, world!

Prompt: For example, for the following code:code: int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "Hello, world!

" );}  We could modify it as follows with a comment:code: int  main ( void )  {  // print a messageprintf ( "Hello, world!

" );}  - Comments can appear anywhere within your code, on their own line or following code. For example, the following two snippets of code are equivalent:code: // this is a commentint  main ( void )  {  // print a messageprintf ( "Hello, world!

" );}  Or:code: int  main ( void )  {  // this is a comment

Prompt: Do not include any other characters after code: //.-  Any characters after code: // will be ignored by the compiler, including whitespace and newlines.  This means that you can safely place a comment after code: //  on the same line as code.-  The following are two examples of how to write comments:```C#include  <stdio.h>   // this is a single-line comment/* this is a multi-line comment that spans over multiple lines, which means we can include a lot of information in a single comment */int  main ( void )  {  // this is a single-line comment that appears after codevoid  say_hello ( void )  {  // this is
Response: The compiler ignores this portion of the code.-  Comments also come in multi-line form, involving code: /* comment */, which allows you to write more than one line of remarks.-  For example, the following is a simple program that outputs a message to the user, involving a single-line comment and a multi-line comment:```C#include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  // this is a single-line commentprintf ( "Hello, world!

" );  /* this is a multi-line comment that spans over multiple lines, which means we can include a lot of information in a single comment */}

Prompt: - The // is known as the comment delimiter, which is telling the computer to treat everything to the right of the comment delimiter as a comment, and to ignore it.-  For example, consider the following code:code: // This program prints a gridint  main ( void )  {  printf ( "Hello, world!

" );}  When you run the program, nothing appears on the screen, since the entire program is a comment.- When you write comments, you should always use proper grammar and punctuation, as if you are writing in an essay, since comments are meant to be read by other people, who will judge your competence based on your comments.-  For example, consider the following code:code
Response: For example, the following code:code: int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user for minutesprintf ( "Minutes: " );  // Get number of minutesint  minutes  =  get_int ( );  // Calculate number of bottlesint  bottles  =  minutes  *  12 ;  // Print number of bottlesprintf ( "Bottles: %i

" ,  bottles );  }  would print:code: Bottles: 48-  In the above example, the line “Bottles: %i

” is not a comment since the rest of the line is not a comment.-  The // is known as the comment delimiter, which is telling the

Prompt: All code on the same line after // will be ignored by the computer.- In this course, you are always required to comment the first line of each program, where you start with the comment characters //, followed by your name and username.- For example, for the program above, you’d write the first line of your program as follows:code: // Author: YOUR NAME HERE (YOUR USERNAME HERE)  As another example, here’s how you might comment a function and the purpose of that function:code: // Prompts user for size until a positive integer is received  int  get_int ( void ) ;  The // symbol tells the computer to ignore everything that comes after it on the same line

Response: For example, the following code writes a message to the screen, and then waits for the user to press the enter key.  - This program writes a message to the screen, pauses for the user to press the enter key, and then exits.code: // A simple program#include <stdio.h>int main (void){printf("This program writes a message to the screen and then exits.

");getchar();return 0;}  - The first line is a comment.  - These lines are ignored by the computer, but they are useful to the human who will read them.  - The line with code: // is a single-line comment.  - The second line has two parts, code: /*

Prompt: Code: // this is a comment where everything after the // is ignored-  You may place comments above or below the code they refer to.  -  You can also write block comments that span multiple lines. Just begin the comment with /* and end it with */.  -  Good comments are important not only for others to understand your code but also for you to understand your code.  -  Good comments are important not only for others to understand your code but also for you to understand your code.

How does the user input the size of the grid?
Response: -  For example, consider the following code:code: // this is a comment where everything after the // is ignored-  You may place comments above or below the code they refer to.  -  You can also write block comments that span multiple lines.

How does the user input the size of the grid? Modify your code as follows:code: int  main ( void )  {  const  int  n

Prompt: What is the purpose of a comment in a computer program?

Comments are used to explain what a particular section of code is doing. They are also used to remind the programmer of what a certain section of code is supposed to do.
Response: // this is a comment

/* 

This is also a comment, 
but it can span multiple lines. 

*/

Prompt: For example, consider the following code:code: // this is a commentint  x  =  50 ; // this is also a comment- The first comment is on a line by itself. The second comment is inline with some code.- As a rule of thumb, you should comment on each block of code you write, both for the benefit of others and yourself. The more complex the code, the more important comments become.- Consider the following code:code: // print a grid#include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  // ask user for size of gridint  n  =  get_int ( "Size: " ); // print
Response: In the following example, the first line is an inline comment, while the second line is a comment that spans multiple lines.code: // this is a commentint  x  =  50 ; // this is also a comment- This syntax is called a comment delimiter and it indicates that everything that comes after the delimiter is not to be executed by the computer.- Some programs will allow you to use other comment delimiters, such as /* */. We will use //, which is the most common form of commenting.## Multiplication  - Multiplication is a basic arithmetic operation that is also an important tool in computer programming.- Multiplication is not just for numbers. It can be applied to strings as well. For

Prompt: For example:  // This is a comment. It is not executed as part of the program.  -  It is considered best practice to comment your code as you write it.  -  When you are collaboration with others, it is also considered best practice to leave clear comments   regarding what you have changed in a file.-  The style guide for this course specifies that comments should be capitalized, as well as use proper grammar.

How do you comment code in C?
Response: -  For example, the following is a valid C program: code: // This program prints a grid printf ( " # # # #

" ); printf ( " # # # #

" ); printf ( " # # # #

" ); printf ( " # # # #

" );  Comments can also span multiple lines: code: // This program prints a grid // It accepts a single command-line argument - // the size of the grid to print.  printf ( " # # # #

" ); printf ( " # # # #

Prompt: - For example, in the following code, the first and third lines are comments, but the second line is code: // this is a comment  printf("hello, world

");  // this is a comment as well

// this is also a comment

int x = 1; // this is a comment

- Any text that appears to the right of // is ignored by the compiler, but is visible to you and others reading your code.

- For longer comments, you can use /* and */, as follows:

/*

This is a longer comment

that spans multiple lines

*/

- The above code would not generate any output.

- We will use comments

Modify your code as follows:Notice how code: n is now a constant. It can never be changed.-  As illustrated earlier in this lecture, we can make our code prompt the user for the size of the grid. Modify your code as follows:Notice that code: get

Prompt: -  Consider the following code:code: // prompt user for a numberprintf ( "Enter a number: " );  - The code: // causes everything to the right of it on the same line to be ignored by the compiler, allowing you to place comments in the same line as code.-  You can also place comments on their own line:code:  // this is a comment  -  Comments can also span multiple lines, which you can do by wrapping the comment in code: /* and code: */ . For example:code: /* This is a multiline comment that spans over multiple lines. */  -  It is important to document your code using comments. This means describing what your code is doing, not just
Response: -  For example:code: // this is a comment  -  Comments can also span multiple lines, which you can do by wrapping the comment in code: /* and code: */ . For example:code: /* This is a multiline comment that spans over multiple lines. */  -  It is important to document your code using comments. This means describing what your code is doing, not just the code itself.  -  This is especially important when working with others, and even more so when working on very large code bases, where you and others may not have time to sit down and discuss each line of code that you are modifying.

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.

Prompt: -  In C, the code: // is called a single-line comment and everything after the code: // on that line is ignored by the compiler. This is useful for commenting out a line of code if it isn’t working, or for single-line comments.   -  There is also a way to write multi-line comments, which is especially useful for larger comments.   -  Multi-line comments begin with code: /*  and end with code: */.  -  In C, everything between the code: /* and code: */ is ignored by the compiler.  -  The following is an example of code with both single- and multi-line comments:  -  // declaring a variable-
Response: -  For example, the following is code with a comment:  -  // this is my first program in CS50  -  Every line of code you write for any problem set must include a comment (at the end of the line!), such that other people can understand what you were trying to accomplish.-  As you will see in a moment, comments are also useful for “commenting out” code that you might want to use later.-  If you ever have a question about what a specific line of code is doing, you can add a comment to that line of code.  -  For example, you can add a comment like this:  -  // this line of code prompts the user for their name

Prompt: For example,code: // this is a comment  -  Comments can be placed on their own lines, or at the end of lines, as illustrated in the example above.  For example,code: // this is a commentint  x  =  5 ;  // this sets x to 5  -  Comments can also span multiple lines.  For example,code: // this is a comment that spans multiple linesint  x  =  5 ;  // this sets x to 5int  y  =  4 ;  // this sets y to 4  -  Comments can also be added to the top of each file.

Prompt: - The text following code: // will not be executed by the computer.  - For example, consider the following code:code: // This is a comment!int  x  =  1 ;int  y  =  2 ;int  z  =  x  +  y ;printf ( "%i" , z );  - When run, the computer will skip over the first line, which is a comment.  - This comment is completely ignored by the computer, and it will not influence the outcome of the program.  - The three lines of code that follow are executed by the computer.  - As a result, the program will print 3 to the screen.  - Another example of a comment is as follows
Response: - For example, consider the following code:code: // This is a comment!int  x  =  1 ;int  y  =  2 ;int  z  =  x  +  y ;printf ( "%i" , z );  - When run, the computer will skip over the first line, which is a comment.  - This comment is completely ignored by the computer, and it will not influence the outcome of the program.  - The three lines of code that follow are executed by the computer.  - As a result, the program will print 3 to the screen.  - Another example of a comment is as follows Modify your code as follows:code: int  main ( void )

Prompt: For example, let’s say our task is to write a function that prints out all of the integers from 1 to n. This can be done as follows:code: int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user for a numberint  n  =  get_int ( "n: " );  // Print integers from 1 to nfor  ( int  i  =  1 ;i  <=  n ;i ++ )  {  printf ( "%i

" ,i );}  }  As you can see, the code: // allows us to leave a comment.-  You can also leave comments that span multiple lines. This can be done by opening the comment with code: /*
Response: -  For example, the following line of code is a comment.code: // This is a comment  -  The comment starts with code: // and ends with the end of the line.  -  The following line of code is also a comment:code: // This is a comment  -  We typically comment every line of code, starting with explaining what our program is doing.  -  For example:code: int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user for a numberint  n  =  get_int ( "n: " );  // Print integers from 1 to nfor  ( int  i  =  1 ;i  <=  n ;i ++ )  {  printf

Prompt: - For example, let’s say your program is a bit longer and you have forgotten what line 4 is doing. In this case, you can insert a comment to remind yourself, as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  n ;do  {  n  =  get_int ( "Size: " );}  while  ( n  <  1 );for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  n ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  n ;j ++ )  {  printf
Response: For example, in the following code, code: // this is a comment is a comment:code: // this is a commentint  main ( void )  {  // this is also a comment}  - You may also include a multi-line comment, which begins with code: /* and ends with code: */. For example,code: /* this is a comment that spans multiple lines.  It continues on the second line */-  It is best practice to include a comment at the beginning of each .c file, providing an overview of what is happening within the program.-  Further, it is best practice to include a comment at the beginning of each function. For example, in the following program, we include two comments

Prompt: - The double slash tells your compiler to ignore everything that follows on the same line.  - The double slash is for single-line comments.  - If you want to write a comment that spans multiple lines, you can use code: /* */ as your delimiters.  - You can use both commenting styles in the same program.  - All of your code should be commented.  - All of your comments should be useful.
-
How do you add a comment in code?
Response: - For example, in the following code snippet, the comment explains what is happening in the code:// This is a commentprintf("#

");// This is a second commentDon’t worry if the above code is confusing to you right now, we will get to the details of printf in a later lecture.  - Any text that follows the double slash will be ignored by the C compiler.  - The double slash tells your compiler to ignore everything that follows on the same line.  - The double slash is for single-line comments.  - If you want to write a comment that spans multiple lines, you can use code: /* */ as your delimiters.  - You can use both commenting styles in the

Prompt: - For example, we could modify our program as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h> // Prints a grid   int  main ( void )  {  int  n ;// Prompt user for ndo  {  n  =  get_int ( "Size: " );}  while  ( n  <  1 );// Prints n-by-n grid for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  n ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  n ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "#" );}  printf ( " \
Response: For example,code: // Prints a grid    int  main ( void )  {  int  n  =  get_int ( "Size: " );for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  n ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  n ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "#" );}  printf ( " \n " );}  }  -  You can also comment out large blocks of code using code: /*  ...  */.  For example,code: /*#include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h> // Prints a grid

Prompt: For example:code: // This is a single-line comment. -  Comments can also span multiple lines. In such cases, you can use the code: /* to start the comment, and code: */ to end the comment.  For example:code: /* This is a multiple-line comment. It has two lines. */ -  Within this course, we will require you to comment every function you write. For example:code: // Draws a right triangle of n-by-n dimensions.void  right_triangle ( int  n )  {  }  -  We will also require you to comment every line of code you write, generally.  For example:code: // Prompt user for size
Response: For example:code: // This is a single-line comment. -  Comments can also span multiple lines. In such cases, you can use code: /* to start the comment, and code: */ to end the comment.

For example:code: // Prompt user for size Mod

Prompt: - The compiler will completely ignore this text and move on to the next line of code.
-
What is the purpose of comments in code?
Response: For example, the following two lines of code are valid:code: // This is a single-line comment  /* This is a multi-line  * comment */  - Comments are not executed by the computer, and therefore do not affect the program’s runtime or result.-  In general, the more comments the better, but don’t overdo it.  You should try to focus on providing meaningful comments, rather than excessively commenting every line of code you write.-  Good comments usually answer a few questions, such as:  -   What is the purpose of this code?  -   What is the purpose of a given variable?  -   What is the purpose of a given function?  -   What

Prompt: For example, this is a comment:code: // This is a comment-  A more advanced form of commenting is to use /* */.  For example, this is also a comment:code: /* This is also a comment */-  Use commenting to explain the purpose of your program.  For example, you might have this as the first comment in your program:code: // Prints a grid of hashes## Style  -  Another fundamental part of a computer program is consistent and readable code.-  The first and most important step in writing readable code is to be consistent.  For example, you might want to always use curly braces {} even when the language may allow you to omit them.  For example, the two pieces

Prompt: For example, the following code would produce a 3x3 checkerboard:  code: // Draws a 3x3 checkerboard#include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  n  =  3 ;// Prints top half of checkerboardfor  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  n ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  n ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "# " );}  printf ( " \n " );}  }  -  For example, the following code would produce a 3
Response: - For example, if you wanted to write a comment explaining to the reader what the following code is doing, you might write something like the following:  code: // Prints top half of checkerboard#include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  int  n  =  3 ;for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  n ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  n ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "# " );}  printf ( " \n " );}  }  -  In the code above, there

Prompt: For example:code: // this program prints a gridint  main ( void )  {  printf ( " #  # \n" );  printf ( " #  # \n" );  printf ( " ##### \n" );}  - If you have a multi-line comment, you can place a code: /* at the beginning of the comment, followed by code: */ at the end of the comment. For example:code: /* this program prints a grid */int  main ( void )  {  printf ( " #  # \n" );  printf ( " #  # \n" );  printf ( " ##### \n" );}  - Good comments will:   - clarify the

Prompt: For example:int  main ( void ){  // Prompt user for xint  x  =  get_int ( "x: " );  // Prompt user for yint  y  =  get_int ( "y: " );  // Sum x and yint  z  =  x  +  y ;  // Print sumprintf ( "%i \n " ,  z );}  Comments also come in multi-line variants.  For example:int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user for x  int  x  =  get_int ( "x: " );  // Prompt user for y  int  y  =  get_int ( "y:
Response: For example:int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user for x  int  x  =  get_int ( "x: " );  // Prompt user for y  int  y  =  get_int ( "y: // Sum x and y  int  z  =  x  +  y ;  // Print sum  printf ( "%i \n " ,  z );}  -  Comments also come in multi-line variants.  For example:int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user for x  int  x  =  get_int ( "x: " );  // Prompt user for y  int  y  =  get_int

Prompt: - For example:code: // this program prints out a messageprintf ( "Hello, world!

" );  In this case, the comment is everything after //, up to the end of the line.-  You can also make block comments, which span multiple lines. They resemble the standard C comment format (described in the next section). For example:code: /* This program prints out a message The message is stored in the variable msg. */  Notice how the /* indicates the beginning of the comment, and */ indicates the end of the comment.  -  You should also use comments to indicate what a program should do, and how it should do it, without necessarily providing the code to accomplish it. For example:code
Response: -  For example, consider the following code:code: // return the number of seconds in a minuteint  minute  =  60 ;  // comment  -  -  For example, consider the following code:code: // return the number of seconds in a minuteint  minute  =  60 ;  // comment  -  -  For example, consider the following code:code: // return the number of seconds in a minuteint  minute  =  60 ;  // comment  -  -  For example, consider the following code:code: // return the number of seconds in a minuteint  minute  =  60 ;  // comment  -  -  For example, consider the following code:

Prompt: This can be done on the same line as code: // some code, or on a separate line like this:code: // this is a comment  // you can also comment out code using code: // like this  // printf("Hello world!

"); -  For example, notice how the following code:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  name  =  get_string ( "What is your name?

" );printf ( "hello, %s

" ,  name );}  can be commented out using the following:code: // #include <cs50.h>
Response: For example, notice how the following code:code: // some code, or on a separate line like this:code: // this is a comment  // you can also comment out code using code: // like this  // printf("Hello world!

"); -  For example, notice how the following code:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  string  name  =  get_string ( "What is your name?

" );printf ( "hello, %s

" ,  name );}  can be commented out using the following:code: // #include <cs50.h>

Prompt: For example, 

int  main ( void ) // this is the main function
{
    // this is a comment
    printf ( "Hello, world!\n" ); // this prints "Hello, world!"
}

- You should also feel free to comment out bits of code that you want to keep around but don’t want to run at the moment. For example, if you want to test different values of x but don’t want to keep typing in different values, you could do something like this:

int  main ( void )
{
    // uncomment the following line to test different values of x
    // int x = get_int("x:
Response: Examples:  // this is a comment  // this function does this  // this is the main function  -  It is important to note that code: // style comments can extend to the end of the line, and will comment out the rest of the code on that line.  For example, 

int  main ( void ) // this is the main function
{
    // this is a comment
    printf ( "Hello, world!\n" ); // this prints "Hello, world!"
}

Prompt: -  For example, let's say we have a program that evaluates an expression, and we want to leave a comment to remind ourselves that we should consider adding support for more operators. We might write something like the following:code: // TODO: Add support for more operators  -  The code: // tells the computer to ignore everything on the rest of the line.  -  The comment: TODO: Add support for more operators is information for us and is not executed by the computer.  -  The reason for using TODO is that some text editors have a feature where they can search through all the comments in your code to find all the TODO items. This can be helpful because it allows you to quickly find parts

In such a case, you must use code: /*  */, like so:code: // Prompts user for grid size/* Prompts user for grid size */  -  Further, you can place comments at the top of your program. Such comments are often useful for describing what your program does and how
Response: For example, if we want to comment on the following line of code:code: int  n  =  get_int ( "Size: " );  We can place a comment after the // as follows:code: int  n  =  get_int ( "Size: " ); // Prompts user for grid size  -  It is often useful to write comments that are two lines long. In such a case, you must use code: /*  */, like so:code: // Prompts user for grid size/* Prompts user for grid size */  -  Further, you can place comments at the top of your program. Such comments are often useful for describing what your program does and how

Prompt: All text to the right of the double slashes is ignored by the compiler, but not by the human reader. Example:   // this is a single-line comment-  Alternatively, you can place code: /* and code: */ around a block of text, which is useful for multiline comments. Example:   /*  this is a   multiline   comment  */

How do you ensure that your code includes robust comments?

Prompt: - For example, consider the following line of code:int  main ( void )  {  // TODO: print a grid}  - The above code is not valid C code, because the comment is not within a valid C statement. However, the above comment is useful in that it reminds the programmer to write code in the main function to print a grid. Notice how the comment doesn’t actually do anything.-  Comments can also span multiple lines by starting the comment with code: /* and ending the comment with code: */ .  - For example, consider the following code:int  main ( void )  {  /* TODO: print a grid TODO: print a newline at the end */}

Prompt: - Everything from the // to the end of the line is considered a comment. - Comments can be placed on their own line, or after code on the same line. - For example, the following are all valid comments:code: // this is a single line commentint  x  =  1 ; // this is a comment on the same line following codeint  y  =  2 ; // this is a comment on the same line following code/* this is a multi-line comment that can span many lines */int  z  =  3 ; // this is a comment on the same line following code-  Comments should be used in the following situations:-  To explain the purpose of a program-  To explain the purpose
Response: For example:code:-  // This line is a comment.-  It is helpful to place comments before the lines of code they refer to.  For example:code:-  // This is a comment-  x  =  0;-  y  =  1;-  z  =  x  +  y;-  However, comments can also be placed on the line above the line of code as well.  For example:code:-  x  =  0;  // This is a comment-  y  =  1;  // This is a comment-  z  =  x  +  y;  // This is a comment-  Finally, comments can also span multiple lines

Prompt: -  For example, suppose you want to write a program to calculate the product of three integers. In pseudocode, you might formulate the following:code: // Get three integers from the user // Calculate the product of the three integers // Print the result // Pseudocode is a great way to start thinking about the logic of a program, but the actual code is much more specific. For example, you might write the following code:code: // Get three integers from the userint  x  =  get_int ( "x: " );int  y  =  get_int ( "y: " );int  z  =  get_int ( "z: " ); // Calculate the product
Response: For example:code: // This comment is a single line comment // This is a comment on two lines // This comment is on a single line // This comment is on a line that // contains code as well The third and fourth comments are technically “single” line comments that span multiple lines. The fifth comment is a “multi” line comment that spans multiple lines.-  Unlike the rest of your code, comments are not executed by your computer.  Rather, comments are read (and often ignored) by other programmers who read and modify your code.  Thus, if you’re working on a large project with many other programmers, it’s important to write comments that explain what your code is doing.-

Prompt: -  For example: 
-  // this coin is a quarter 
-  // this coin is a dime 
-  // this coin is a nickel 
-  // this coin is a penny 
-  The code: #include <cs50.h> #include <stdio.h> int main(void) { // prompt user for a number between 1 and 8 int n; do { n = get_int("Height: "); } while (n < 1 || n > 8); // print n-1 spaces for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) { printf(" "); } // print 1 hash printf("#"); // start new line
Response: -  For example, consider the following code that prompts the user for a number and prints it out:
-  // Prompt the user for a number between 1 and 10
-  int n = get_int("Number: ");
-  // Print out the number
-  printf("The number is %i\n", n);
-  -  We recommend that you comment early and often, as you develop your program.
-  -  Code that is not commented is often referred to as code: obtuse
-  -  You should also use comments to comment out code that you are not using. This is often helpful when trying to debug your code. For example, you may have

Prompt: This is an example of a valid single-line comment:

// this line prints a new line
-  To write a multi-line comment, you start with  /* and end with  */. 
Here is an example of a valid multi-line comment:

/*

This is a multi-line comment.

*/
-  As a best practice, you should always comment the purpose of a function immediately above the function declaration, including a description of each of the function’s parameters. For example:

/*

Prints out a pyramid of a specified height

*/
void print_pyramid(int n);

-  Another best practice is to comment
Response: For example: 
 
-  To write a single-line comment, you start with  // and end with  a new line. 
This is an example of a valid single-line comment:

// this line prints a new line
-  To write a multi-line comment, you start with  /* and end with  */.

Prompt: For example, consider the following code:code: // this program prints hello worldhello, world // this program also prints hello world-  The first line // this program prints hello world is an example of commenting out a line of code. This is useful if you want to temporarily disable a line of code without completely deleting it. The second line hello, world is not executed by the program because it is commented out.  -  The // this program also prints hello world comment does not affect the code that follows it.  -  Be aware that you can comment out multiple lines of code as follows:code: // this program prints hello worldhello, world // this program also prints hello worldhello, world // this program also also prints hello
Response: -  For example, the following code would print I am about to print Hello, world!  to the screen and then print Hello, world!  to the screen:code: // print hello worldprintf ( "I am about to print Hello, world!

" );printf ( "Hello, world!

" );  -  Comments can also be used to comment out entire lines of code.  For example, if you wanted to keep the previous code, but not have it execute, you could comment out the entire second line as follows:code: // print hello worldprintf ( "I am about to print Hello, world!

" );// printf ("Hello, world!

");}  The first two lines are comments. They are completely ignored by the program.-  For all code you write in this course, you must include at least two comments:  -  The first comment is called a “file header” and is placed at the top of each program. This comment must include the course, section, and your full name.-  The second comment is called a “function header” and is placed at the top of each function within your program (including
Response: -  For example, code: // this is a comment that is ignored by the program.  -  You can also place comments on multiple lines. For example:code: // this is a comment that spans multiple lines. // It is useful for providing more information than // a single line comment. // Of course, the comment can span more lines than // this.  -  You may also comment out code that you don’t want to run. For example, code: int  main ( void )  {  printf ( "Hello, world

Prompt: - Comments are not executed as part of the program.
- As you write more and more code, you will find that it becomes increasingly more difficult for you to remember why you wrote certain lines of code. 
- As such, it is important to always add comments to your code as you write it, to remind you of your thought process later.
- Good comments are clear and concise, explaining what the code is doing without going into excessive detail.

What is the difference between // and /* */ comments in C?

The difference between // and /* */ comments in C is that // comments can only be used on a single line, while /* */ comments can span multiple lines.
Response: -  The following code is a simple example of how comments are used. 
-  Test it to see how it works. 
-  Modify the code to include comments to explain what each line of code is doing.
-  Notice that code: // can appear on the same line as the code it is commenting, or on its own line.
