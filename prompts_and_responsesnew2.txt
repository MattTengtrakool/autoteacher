10. How do you use the cs50.h library
Response: In this case, it is used to get the user’s name.- Notice also the code: string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); In this case, you are creating a variable called code: answer and assigning it the value code: get_string("What's your name? ");. What that means is that the value of code: answer is going to be whatever the user enters when prompted with code: "What's your name? "- Notice also the printf statement. What the %s does is substitute in the value of code: answer for %s in the output of the printf statement. In this case, the output of the statement will be “hello, (whatever the user entered for

1. The first thing you learned in the text is how to create your first program in C.
2. You can create your own functions in C by using the keyword "function."
3. Some of the predefined functions that come with C include "printf" and "scanf."
4. You can use variables, conditionals, and loops in your code by using the keywords "var," "if," and "for."
5. The Linux command line is a text-based interface that can be used to execute commands.
6. When solving a computer science problem, you should approach it by breaking it down into smaller pieces.

Prompt: In your terminal window, type code: code meow.c and write code as follows:code: #include  <cs50.h> #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  // Prompt user for int  int  n  =  get_int ( "n: " );// Print n meows for  ( int  i  =  0 ; i  <  n ; i ++ )  {  printf ( "meow \n " );}  }  Notice that we no longer need to set the value of code: i=- What is the difference between a while loop and a for loop?
- What is the difference between = and == in
Response: In the text editor, write the following:code: #include  <stdio.h>   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  3 ; i  >  0 ; i -- )  {  printf ( "meow \n " );}}  Notice how we utilize the code: for keyword to create a loop.  Within the parentheses, we create our counter code: i, start it at code: 3 and end it at code: 0. Each time the loop runs, it will reduce code: i by code: 1. Once the counter has reached code: 0, the loop will end.  Note that the variable code: i is only available within the scope

For example, to delete code: hello.c, you would type code: rm hello.c .- Deleting a directory is done using the code: rmdir command.  For example, to delete the directory code: cats, you would type code: rmdir cats .- The terminal window is where we type our commands.  It is also known as a command prompt or shell.- An operating system is a software program that enables the computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software.

Prompt: -  We can do so by adding a constant to our code. Let’s name this constant blocks. Add the following line of code:define blocks 3  -  Then, we can modify our code as follows:code: #include  <stdio.h>   define blocks 3   int  main ( void )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;i  <  blocks ;i ++ )  {  for  ( int  j  =  0 ;j  <  blocks ;j ++ )  {  printf ( "#" );}  printf ( " \n " );}  }
